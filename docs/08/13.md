## 8.13.1 Introduction to ACLs

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Linux Permissions 00:00-00:25
In this lesson, we'll go over Linux permissions. Linux has three sets of permissions: r for read, w for write, and x for execute. These are provided for the user or owner, the primary group, and everyone else. You'll see them displayed as the standard file and directory permissions on a given Linux system. And they're fairly easy to change; we use the chmod utility to do so.

FACLs 00:25-00:43
Now, as you may imagine, a Linux administrator might want to add additional permissions to the files and directories. ACLs augment standard permission assignments and allow the system admin to set additional ones for specific users and groups. The setfacl and getfacl utilities are what we use to grant these additional permissions. Let's look at those.

getfacl 00:43-01:28
getfacl displays the current ACL list. By default, all files and directories have three permission sets configured automatically: User, Group, and Other. The ls �l command displays a long listing of files that includes the permissions, owner, and the primary group. Take note of the dot here at the end of the permissions list. The output from the getfacl command shows very similar information. You see the filename, owner, and primary group—and each individual permission set. The dot at the end of the permission list indicates that there are no ACLs set on this directory. There are several command line options available for getfacl. Enter getfacl --help to see all the available options. Let's talk about setfacl now.

setfacl 01:28-02:32
setfacl applies ACLs to files and directories. Here, we're using setfacl to create ACLs for a user and a group. We start with the utility itself, setfacl. Then we modify the ACL for the carol user, giving her read, write, and execute. After that, we modify the ACL for the marketing group, giving it read and write. And we're applying these ACLs to the testout-acl directory.

Now when we use getfacl to show us the ACL list, we see that the carol user and the marketing group have been added with their own permissions. Also, let's not forget about that dot at the end. With our ACLs set now, that dot changes to a plus sign, indicating that ACLs are configured for the file or directory. As with getfacl, there are many command line options available for setfacl—such as �b, which removes all extended ACLs, and �R, which makes the command recursive. You can issue the setfacl --help command to see more of these.

Summary 02:32-03:04
That's all for this lesson. All in all, creating an access control list for files and directories extends the role that permissions play on a Linux file system. The ACL starts with the standard permissions given to the user or owner and then extends to the primary group, followed by all other system users. Using the setfacl utility gives the system admin the ability to make more granular permission assignments to select users and groups. Then you can view the effective ACLs using the getfacl utility.

## 8.13.2 Using ACLs

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

What is an ACL? 00:00-00:21
In this demo, I'm going to demonstrate how to use Access Control lists in Linux. Access Control lists, or ACLs, are a mechanism that provide flexible permissions to files and folders. ACLs allow us to give permissions to any user or group beyond the default Linux file permissions.

Use an ACL 00:21-00:56
For example, we have jgonzalez, a user who is not a member of the Employees group. He's an intern. We need to give him permissions to folders and files, but we can't add him to the Employees group. This is where ACLs come in. We can set permissions to specific files or folders that would allow jgonzalez to read or write to them.

Before we begin, let's run ls -l on /corp_files/. We see two files owned by jmace that belong to the Employees group. Using an ACL, we can grant access to these files for the jgonzalez user. The two commands we'll use are setfacl and getfacl.

Grant User Permissions 00:56-03:11
Before we begin, we need to review the default permissions for the directory we want to give users access to. We'll use the getfacl command. Enter getfacl /corp_files/. This will return data, and we see that users have read, write, and execute permissions. Groups and others have read and execute permissions.

ACLs are an extension of the system's default file permissions. We'll need to run a command to enable, or set, these extended permissions for other users and groups.

We have two files in the corp files directory, marketing_figures.txt and webpage.html. Let's give jgonzalez read and write access to the marketing figures text file. We'll type setfacl -m u:jgonzalez:rw /corp_files/marketing_figures.txt. The m stands for modify. We identify a user to add to the ACL, jgonzalez, who will receive read and write permissions to the marketing figures text file. Let's run getfacl /corp_files/marketing_figures.txt. We see the user jgonzalez has read and write permissions to the file.

When we list contents of the corp files directory again, we see a plus symbol (+) at the end of the permissions. This signifies that an ACL is in place and granting further permissions. webpage.html does not have an ACL applied and does not have a plus sign.

Let's switch users using su. As the jgonzalez user, we'll open the marketing figures file in a text editor. Run nano /corp_files/marketing_figures.txt. We see a warning that the directory corp files is not writable. This is due to nano reading the default permissions of the file and not the ACL. Let's add text and write to the file. We see that the user jgonzalez was able to write to the file. Exit the text editor.

Grant Group Permissions 03:11-04:30
Let's try and edit the webpage.html file. Open the file in a text editor. We receive the same warning that the directory is not writable. When we type text in and attempt to write to the file, we receive a Permission denied error. We haven't set up an ACL on this file. Let's exit jgonzalez's session.

Let's add the entire intern group this time. We'll type setfacl -m g:interns:rw- /corp_files/webpage.html. The g specifies that a group will be added to the ACL. We have added read and write permissions to the interns group for the webpage.html file. Run getfacl on the webpage file. We can see that the interns group has read and write permissions.

Let's su back into jgonzalez's account. Open the webpage.html file in a text editor again. Again, we receive the warning that the directory is not writable. Let's go ahead and make edits to the file. Since jgonzalez is a part of the Interns group, he'll inherit the read and write permissions for the file. We're able to successfully write to the file. Exit the session.

Default ACLs 04:30-06:49
To give permissions to all files within a folder, we set default ACLs. Default ACLs are inherited by newly created files. Files that existed before the default ACL was created need to have their permissions configured manually.

To give jgonzalez permissions to all files within the corp files folder, type setfacl -dm u:jgonzalez:rw /corp_files/. The d specifies that we're adding or editing the default ACL. Only directories can have default ACLs configured. The m specifies that we're modifying the ACL. The two options together mean we're modifying the default ACLs for the corp files folder. The u identifies that we're changing the default ACL for a user and providing them with read and write permissions. Finally, we end the command with the directory we're adding the permissions to.

Let's run getfacl /corp_files/ again. We see new entries that begin with the word default. As you can see, our default entry for users shows jgonzalez added to the ACL. He'll receive read and write permissions by default for files within the folder. If a user needs execute permissions too, we can specify that when granting them permissions.

We see the default group and other have read and execute permissions. The default mask and user have read, write, and execute. Since these are corporate files, we want to protect them and make sure users, mask, and groups have read and write permissions. Others should only have read access. We'll run setfacl -dm g::rw /corp_files/ and press Enter. Next, we'll enter setfacl -dm m::rw /corp_files/. Finally, we'll type setfacl -dm o::r /corp_files/ and press Enter. When we run getfacl /corp_files/ again, we see the permissions are set.

Summary 06:49-07:07
And that wraps up this demo. In this demonstration, we talked about configuring Access Control Lists. We discussed setting default permissions for directories, user permissions for files, and group permissions for files.

## 8.13.3 ACL Facts

Although the standard permissions for the user, group, and others are functional in a general sense, sometimes greater, fine-grained access control is needed for file and folder permissions on Linux. File Access Control Lists (ACLs), can provide more precise permissions to a Linux file system.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- ACL overview
- View ACLs
- Set ACLs

### ACL Overview

File ACLs augment standard permission assignments, allowing the definition of additional permissions for any number of specific users and groups. For example, instead of just assigning permissions to the owning user, the owning group, and then everyone else, by using ACLs, we can specify that multiple users have the same permissions as the owner, or several groups have the same access as the owning group. The same read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions are used, but they are extended to additional users or groups.

### ls -l

`-rwxrw-r--+  1  jmace  employees  27  Oct    3  19:19 marketing_figures.txt`

There are also default ACLs. Default ACLs are set on a folder so that any files or folders created inside will inherit the defaults.

### View ACLs

To see the ACLs for a file or directory, use the getfacl command:

```shell
[root@localhosL /]# qetfacl testout-acl/ # file: testout-acl/ # owner: root # group: root user::rwx user:carol:rwx group::r-x group:marketing:rw- mask::rwx other::r-x
```

As you can see from the above output, there is a user ACL for "carol" granting read, write, and execute (rwx) permissions. There is also a group ACL for "marketing" granting read and write (rw-) permissions.

### Set ACLs

Adding ACLs to a file is accomplished using the setfacl command, such as this one:

```shell
[root@localhost /]# setfacl -m u:carol:rwx -m g:marketing:rw testout-acl/
```

In the example above, the -m stands for modify, the u is for user, followed by the name of the user in between two colons, then the permissions rwx. The g is for the group, then the group name in between colons, then the permissions rw, followed by the file (or folder) to be affected.
