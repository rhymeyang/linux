## 5.2.1 Comparing Linux Desktops

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Introduction 00:00-00:17
Most Linux distributions have a default desktop environment, or configuration of menus, icons, files, and folders. However, there are dozens of environments to choose from. In this video, we'll briefly look at a few of the most common.

GNOME 00:17-01:27
The first GUI we'll look at is GNOME, one of the most popular desktop environments. Chances are, you've already used GNOME, as it's the default GUI for current Fedora and Ubuntu distributions.

The GNOME environment is minimalistic – as you can see, most of this space is blank. The only interactive elements are in this panel, at the top of the screen. At the far right is the user menu. Here, you can view information about your volume, network connection, and battery level. You can also open the Settings menu to configure your system settings.

The most important part of the top panel is the Activities menu. This is where you can launch applications. There are three ways to do this. The easiest way is to click one of these icons in the quick launch bar. If you know the name of the application you want to run, you can type it into this search bar. Or you can click Show Applications to see all the applications installed on the system. With applications open, you can use the Activities menu to choose which one to bring to the front. You can also use this menu to close applications.

At the right of the screen, you can see your available workspaces. To create a new workspace, drag an application to the blank icon at the bottom of the list. Now, you can use this menu to switch between workspaces.

Unity 01:27-02:04
Next, we'll look at Unity, which is primarily available on Ubuntu distributions. In fact, it was the default GUI for Ubuntu until 2017, when they switched to GNOME. At the top right are menu buttons for network, volume, and other system settings. Along the left is a quick launch bar. This icon, at the top, opens a search bar, where you can search for files and applications on your computer.

You can switch between open applications by using their icons in the quick launch bar. One thing to be aware of is that application menus are hidden until you hover over the bar at the top of the screen. To close an application, click the X at the top left corner.

MATE 02:04-02:25
The next GUI is MATE, which is based on an early version of GNOME. Like the other environments we've seen, the top-right corner has menus for network, volume, and system settings. The Menu button in the top-left corner opens a drop-down where we can view the installed applications, grouped by category. These icons in the bottom-right corner are for switching between workspaces.

Cinnamon 02:25-02:47
Now let's look at the Cinnamon environment, which was designed to resemble Microsoft Windows. At the bottom-right corner, we find our familiar network and system settings. At the bottom left is the Menu button, which is similar to the Start button on Windows. From here, you can search the computer, launch applications, or browse the file system. You can switch between open applications by clicking their icons on the taskbar.

KDE Plasma 02:47-03:12
Finally, we have KDE Plasma. Down here, in the bottom-right corner, we have our network and system settings. On the left, we have the main menu, where we can launch applications or browse the file system. As you can see, KDE has a thing for words that start with K. At the top right, we have a menu with options for customizing the display. For example, we can open a panel with a variety of widgets, or small applications that run on the desktop.

Summary 03:12-03:32
We've just taken a brief look at five common Linux desktop environments: GNOME, Unity, MATE, Cinnamon, and KDE Plasma. As you probably noticed, these environments have more similarities than differences, and the best one for you comes down to personal preference.

## 5.2.2 Comparing Linux Desktops Facts

In Linux, a desktop or desktop environment is a way to bundle together various components in a graphical user interface (GUI). These components include such things as wallpapers, desktop icons, toolbars, and desktop widgets. Most Linux desktop environments also include a set of integrated applications and utilities.

This lesson compares and contrasts a few of the commonly used Linux GUIs.

This lesson covers the following topics:

<ul><li>Installing a Linux desktop</li>
<li>Selecting a Linux desktop</li>
<li>GNOME</li>
<li>Unity</li>
<li>Cinnamon</li>
<li>Mate</li>
<li>KDE</li></ul>

### Installing a Linux Desktop

While installing your Linux workstation, many distributions give you the option of which desktop to install. For the distributions that do not, or if you just want to add an additional desktop, you can install the desired desktop at a later time. The method of installation will vary depending on the distribution and the desktop being installed. In most cases, a simple internet search will locate the detailed steps required.

The following is an examination of how to install the GNOME desktop on Ubuntu:

<ol><li>Open a terminal window</li>
<li>Run: <b class="fw-bold">sudo apt update</b></li>
<li>Run: <b class="fw-bold">sudo apt install ubuntu-gnome-desktop</b></li>
<li>Follow the remaining prompts</li>
<li>Restart your computer after the installation is complete</li></ol>

### Selecting a Desktop

When more than one desktop has been installed, you can select which desktop to run from the login screen. This is typically done by clicking on an icon or a drop-down list located on the logon screen. Each distribution may vary on how this is done. The images below show two examples:

#### Ubuntu

#### Fedora

### GNOME

GNOME (pronounced nōme) is one of the most popular desktop environments and is the default GUI for many distributions, such as Fedora and Ubuntu. Gnome is an acronym for GNU Network Object Model Environment.

When using GNOME, you typically have the choice of using several variations of GNOME, including:

<ul><li>GNOME Classic</li>
<li>GNOME on Xorg</li>
<li>GNOME</li>
<li>GNOME (Wayland)</li></ul>

Although each of these looks similar in appearance, they use different X servers or are built with different toolkits. Each flavor of GNOME differs somewhat on how the initial desktop looks, but most have or can be configured with the following:

![Configuration options on the GNOME desktop](/images/05/gnome_desktop.jpg)

<ul>
<li>
A getting started tutorial - This tutorial is shown the first time a
user logs onto the desktop, showing how to perform common tasks.
</li>
<li>
Dash - Contains icon shortcuts to the most frequently used
applications. To view the dash, click on
<b>Activities</b>.
</li>
<li>
Search - The search field lets you enter a name of a desired
application or function. The desktop will then show a list of possible
hits.
</li>
<li>
Top bar - Includes links to default functions. In this example,
clicking on the down arrow at the right end and expanding
<b>Admin</b> displays user management options. Clicking on
<b>Activities</b> at the left end shows the view in the example above.
</li>
<li>
Show applications - Displays all of the currently installed
applications.
</li>
</ul>

#### Unity

Unity was primarily available on Ubuntu distributions and, when used, was shown as the Ubuntu Desktop. Unity was the default GUI for Ubuntu until 2017, when they switched to GNOME. By default, Unity displays a launch bar populated with several shortcuts, such as Search, Files, Web Browser, System Settings, and Software.

The Search link in the launch bar makes finding menu entries quick and easy. Once selected, you enter a keyword or two and select the correct result from the list. In lieu of launching an application, after finding it in search, you can drag it to the launch bar. Likewise, you can right-click on a launch bar item and choose to unlock it from the launch bar. In the top bar, on the right side, you have access to such things as Network Settings, Character Map, Calendar, and Settings.

#### Cinnamon

The Cinnamon desktop was derived from GNOME 3 but followed traditional desktop metaphor conventions. Cinnamon is the principal desktop environment of the Linux Mint distribution and is available as an optional desktop for other Linux distributions. Although Cinnamon is built on GNOME technologies and uses GTK+, it no longer requires GNOME itself to be installed.

![Features of the Cinnamon desktop](/images/05/cinnamon_desktop.jpg)

The Cinnamon desktop closely resembles the Windows desktop, including a shortcut panel (taskbar) with access to basic settings, such as User Information, Networking, Time, and Main Menu giving you access to your favorites and other settings and applications. The Main Menu also includes a search feature to help you find a needed application or feature.

Main menu:

![Cinnamon desktop Main menu](/images/05/cinnamon_menu.jpg)

You also have the option to add desktop icons, providing quick access to such things as the Home directory, Trash, Computer, Mounted volumes, and the Network.

Another nice feature with Cinnamon is the ability to modify what is shown on the panel and move the panel to any edge of the screen (top, left, right, or bottom). These changes are made by right-clicking on the panel and selecting the applicable options. This feature is available on a few other desktops, such as MATE and KDE.

#### MATE

MATE (pronounced Ma-teh) was started by an Argentine Arch Linux user in response to the negative reception of GNOME 3. MATE's goal is to maintain and continue the latest GNOME 2 code base, frameworks, and core applications.

![Feature of the MATE desktop](/images/05/mate_desktop.jpg)

Like the other environments discussed in this lesson, the top-right corner has menus for Network, Volume, and System Settings. The Menu link in the top-left corner opens a drop-down where you can view the installed applications grouped by category. The icons in the bottom-right corner are for switching between workspaces.

#### KDE

![Features of the KDE desktop](/images/05/kde_desktop.jpg)

KDE is an acronym for K Desktop Environment. Like Cinnamon, KDE also emulates the Windows desktop in that most of its menu options are located on the bottom panel bar. This panel bar can be customized to include favorite shortcuts to applications, services, and widgets. For example, on the right side of this panel, you can see several options similar to Windows, such as Time, Volume controls, and Networking.

Clicking on the KDE icon, found at the right of the panel bar, displays the Main Menu options. By default, the items added to the Favorites menu are shown, but as you can see, you can view other menu items such as Application, Computer, History, and Leave (power options). In the upper-right area of the desktop, there is another menu to access the options shown.
