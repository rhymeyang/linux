## 12.8.1 Troubleshooting Methodology

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Troubleshooting Methodology 00:00-00:36
In this lesson, we're going to discuss troubleshooting methodology.

Good troubleshooting skills are essential for every Linux system administrator. Some issues will be fast and easy to troubleshoot, whereas others can be time-consuming and somewhat frustrating.

So, how can you become good at troubleshooting? Well, first, you need a solid troubleshooting procedure or methodology. Second, you need to have a working knowledge of the various troubleshooting tools at your disposal. Third, the more experience you have troubleshooting issues, the better you'll get at it.

Troubleshooting Model 00:36-01:21
Network problems can be caused by a wide array of issuesâ€”we can't even begin to cover all of them here. However, what we can do is focus on using a standardized troubleshooting process. By using a standardized process, you can adapt and resolve a wide range of network problems.

What happens if you don't use a model? Well, administrators often try one fix after the other, hoping that one will magically repair the problem. While this may seem reasonable, it can be risky, especially when working on a live system. If you accidentally try the wrong fix, you could cause an even bigger problem.

Let's look at an example of a standard troubleshooting model. The goal of this model is to identify the source of the problem before you start trying to fix things.

Gather Information 01:21-01:45
You do this by first gathering information. This step is critical. To effectively identify the problem, you'll want to gather information to help determine the symptoms.

What were the error messages that were displayed?

How extensive is the problem? Is it isolated to just one system, or are there many systems on the network experiencing the same problem?

How many users are impacted? And so on.

Next, you need to identify what has changed in the system or network.

Identify What Has Changed 01:45-01:57
Has new software or hardware been installed? Have you performed an upgrade? Did a user change something? Or did you change something?

Create a Hypothesis 01:57-02:31
Now, using the information you've gathered and considering what has changed, you can start to create a hypothesis. For this step, you may need to do some research. You could check your documentation for previous incidents and fixes.

The internet is also a great resource. Frequently asked questions, vendor documentation, knowledge bases, forums, and so on are abundant on the internet.

You may also want to consult with coworkers. This can be helpful, especially if you want to run your hypothesis by them before moving on. Ideally, you want to narrow your results to one or two likely causes.

The next step is to determine an appropriate fix.

Determine the Appropriate Fix 02:31-03:14
Keep in mind that this step isn't fixing! We're just deciding what the problem is and how we're going to fix it. Similar to the previous step, you may need to consult various sources on the internet, talk to your peers, review documentation, and maybe even draw on your own experience to identify what steps you need to take to fix the problem.

As you do this, be sure to identify the possible ramifications of implementing the fix. Will it impact active systems? Users? Critical applications or infrastructure? Sometimes a fix can cause just as much if not more damage than the original problem, so it's important to consider all ramifications.

Implement the Fix 03:14-03:34
Step five is to implement the fix. At this point, you're ready to use your previously gathered information to start making changes. Once you finish implementing the fix, be sure to take the time to go back through to verify that the fix really did repair the problem, that each symptom has been resolved, and that the issue doesn't reappear again.

Ensure User Satisfaction 03:34-03:55
Part of ensuring that the issue has been resolved is to touch base with the user to ensure they're satisfied with the outcome. If a problem affects users, you need to make sure to communicate the nature of the problem to them. Make sure they know that it has been fixed. If applicable, you can also take the opportunity to give them tips on how to keep the problem from occurring in the future.

Document the Solution 03:55-04:30
Last but definitely not least is to document the problem and the solution. There's a good chance something similar will happen again, so you want to have quick access to the resolution. This way, you don't have to go as far to research if it happens again! Be sure to explain the problem in detail, making sure to include information about the cause of the problem and the fix that was implemented.

This troubleshooting model is not all-inclusive. You're going to have to add, remove, or reorganize the various steps to match your particular situation. However, the model does provide a good starting point.

That's it for this lesson.

Summary 04:30-04:43
In this lesson, we talked about troubleshooting. We reviewed the seven steps included in a standard troubleshooting model.

## 12.8.2 Troubleshooting Methodology Facts

Good troubleshooting is a process that combines knowledge, experience, and intuition.

This lesson presents an effective troubleshooting process.

### Troubleshooting Process

The following process has proven effective in a variety of situations:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Step</th>
    <th>Explanation</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Identify the symptoms and potential causes</td>
    <td>
      When identifying the problem and potential causes, do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Ask the user to describe the problem.</li>
        <li>Check for error messages.</li>
        <li>Recreate the problem.</li>
        <li>Identify the affected area.</li>
        <li>Determine how large the problem is.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, fixes for one client workstation would likely be very
        different from fixes for an entire network segment.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Establish what has changed</td>
    <td>
      Ask questions to discover what might have changed that could have
      caused the problem. Problems are frequently caused by a change to
      the system, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Adding new hardware</li>
        <li>Installing new software</li>
        <li>Making configuration changes</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Create a hypothesis</td>
    <td>
      Create a hypothesis by reviewing the list of potential causes and
      selecting the most probable cause. Look for common errors or
      solutions that can be tried quickly.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Create an action plan</td>
    <td>
      Create an action plan and account for side effects of the proposed
      plan. The plan might require purchases that need approval before
      proceeding. In addition, the plan might involve taking services
      offline for a period of time. Identifying the effects ahead of time
      helps put measures into place to eliminate or reduce any potential
      negative consequences.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. Implement the fix</td>
    <td>
      Implement the fix and then make sure that the solution has fully
      fixed the issue and has not caused any other problems. If necessary,
      implement additional steps to correct the problem if the first
      solution did not work.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6. Ensure user satisfaction</td>
    <td>
      Ensuring user satisfaction may include educating the user, such as
      explaining what the problem was, the solution, and how to avoid the
      problem in the future.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7. Document the solution</td>
    <td>
      Document the solution to the problem. If problems occur in the
      future, check the documentation first to see what has changed or to
      recall the solution to common problems.
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Remember, troubleshooting is a process of both deduction and induction. Field experience is critical to developing troubleshooting skills.

## 12.8.3 Using Network Troubleshooting Tools

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Use Network Troubleshooting Tools 00:00-00:08
We're going to introduce you to several tools that you can use to troubleshoot network problems.

Use ping 00:08-02:25
Let's look at the ping utility. The ping utility is a very useful troubleshooting tool.

The ping command works by sending an Internet Control Message Protocol, or ICMP, echo request to the target system. If the target system receives these ICMP packets, it responds by sending an echo reply packet.

To see how this works, let's ping a different system by typing ping 172.27.237.183 and then pressing Enter.

On a Linux system, the ping command will, by default, continue to send these ping commands until you press Ctrl + C.

The result of each ping request is displayed on a single line.

The first field specifies the size of the echo response packet that it received from the target system.

This field displays the IP address of the system responding to the ping. It's the same IP address we used in our ping command.

We also have a ttl, or time-to-live, parameter shown here. The ttl parameter specifies the number of routers that the echo response packet is allowed to cross before it's discarded. Every time that packet crosses a router, this value is decremented by one. In this example, it wasn't decremented at all because we didn't cross any routers. This is because the target system is on the same network segment as my computer.

The main purpose of ttl is to drop unnecessary traffic from the network segment. If you have a packet that has crossed so many routers that the ttl value reaches zero, then the next router that receives it refuses to forward it any further.

The last field shows us the round-trip time. This tells us how long it took to send the ICMP echo request and receive the ICMP echo response. This parameter can help you identify situations where you might have some latency in the network.

The source computer will continue to send ping requests until you manually stop it. If you want to send a few pings to see if a system is reachable, you can tell ping to only send a specified number of ping requests. This is done by adding -c, which stands for count, followed by the number of ping packets we want to send. Let's run the ping command and insert -c4. This time, the ping only ran four times and then automatically ended.

Ping Using Hostnames 02:25-03:05
It's a best practice to ping IP addresses when troubleshooting network communication problems. This eliminates the dependency that ping would have on a name resolution service when using a hostname.

If a name server isn't available, and you ping using a hostname, it may lead to a false conclusion that there's a problem in your network infrastructure or the computer itself, when in fact, it could be a misconfigured DNS server address.

However, you can run the ping command using the hostname. For example, when I run ping -c4 fs2, we see that this hostname was resolved to its associated IP address, and then that IP address is used to complete the ping.

Use traceroute 03:05-04:12
Next, we're going to review the traceroute utility. The purpose of traceroute is to identify the network route that packets take to get from one system to another. It's an excellent troubleshooting tool because it can help identify any routers causing problems along the way.

The syntax for using traceroute is just to type traceroute, followed by the IP address or DNS name of the host that you want to trace the route to.

Let's run traceroute google.com and press Enter. As the command runs, every single router in the path from my system through the internet to google.com is listed. When running this command, you might see a few routes where an asterisk is shown. It doesn't mean that a router didn't respond or isn't functioning properly. Instead, it means that the router at that hop didn't respond to the type of packet you were using for the traceroute before a timeout occurred.

The traceroute command used the IPv4 protocol to trace the route from this host to google.com. If your network supports IPv6, you can use traceroute6 and specify the hostname you're trying to connect to.

Use mtr 04:12-06:51
Another useful troubleshooting utility is the mtr utility. 'mtr' stands for My Traceroute. This utility combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping utilities into a single network diagnostic tool. When run, it not only shows the route to the destination host but also continues to send purposely low time-to-live, or TTL, packets, which allow mtr to collect data on how the different routes are functioning.

Let's run mtr google.com. As you can see, you're shown the same basic route to our target host that we saw when we ran traceroute. To get the best use of this tool, it's best to let it run for at least 10 to 15 minutes.

Under the Loss% column, we see the percentage of packets that failed to reach their destination while running the utility. Most routes have a very low percentage of packets that've been lost. However, notice that on host 10, there's a more significant loss of packets. A sudden increase in packet loss or response time like this could be an indication that the host has an overloaded or bad link, or it could be caused by an ISP setting rate limits.

As long as the host with the spike in lost packets isn't at the end of the route, you probably don't need to worry. If the spike comes at the end, then it's probably an indication that there's a connection problem.

Another important area to monitor is the Last column. This column tracks the latency. The lower the latency, the better. Generally speaking, anything under 100 milliseconds is ideal. If it spikes higher than 100 milliseconds, there may be a problem with the connection. Possible causes of high latency are many, but common causes include congestion and misconfigured routers.

If you find an issue that seems out of your control, you can run mtr using the -rw options. The -r tells mtr to run for a specified number of cycles and then prints the statistics collected and exits. If you need more than the default number of cycles, you can use the -c option to specify the desired number. The -w option tells mtr to use the long version of the hostname so you or a technician can see the full hostname of each hop.

Let's run mtr -rw google.com and output the results to a file named myreport. Since the output is going to a file, you'll not see anything until the report has been created.

Let's run cat myreport to view the results. This file could then be sent to a manager or a technician for further analysis.

Summary 06:51-07:08
In this demonstration, we looked at several useful network tools that can be used to troubleshoot network problems. We first looked at the ping command, then looked at traceroute. And we ended this demonstration by examining the mtr utility.

## 12.8.4 Troubleshooting Tool Facts

When troubleshooting network communications, there are a number of considerations you have to take into account. There are also a number of tools specifically designed to help you troubleshoot your network.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Network communication troubleshooting
- Network communications troubleshooting tools

### Network Communication Troubleshooting

When experiencing problems with network communications, consider the following:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Problem</th>
  <th>Considerations</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Physical issues</td>
  <td>
    The best way to verify if a connection is valid is to check the link
    light on both the workstation and the switch. If the link light is
    unlit, try the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Swap the cables. This helps determine whether the cable is the
        problem.
      </li>
      <li>Try using a different switch port for the connection.</li>
      <li>Make sure that the card is properly seated.</li>
      <li>
        Use loopback plugs to test network cards and cable testing
        devices to test network cables.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Interference</td>
  <td>
    Interference is caused by electromagnetic fields or radio frequency
    interference. Check the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        For wired cables, make sure wires are not routed next to motors
        or fluorescent lights that can cause interference.
      </li>
      <li>
        For wireless devices, make sure that there are no other devices
        in the area transmitting on the same frequency and channel
        (e.g., microwaves or cordless phones).
      </li>
      <li>
        Check to make sure that the cable is not kinked or worn. Cables
        should be routed through walls or ceilings, not strung across
        the floor. If a cable must run across the floor, encase the
        cable to prevent wear, and secure the cable in place to prevent
        tripping accidents. Worn cables might introduce some
        interference, or simply prevent signals from being sent
        properly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check for dropped packets or detected collisions, as well as
        link status.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Network issues</td>
  <td>
    If the device and its connection appear to be working correctly,
    check the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Check firewalls on both end devices to see if communications are
        being blocked by a host-based firewall.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check the service on the target device to make sure that it is
        running and is properly configured.
      </li>
      <li>Verify subnet and routing configurations.</li>
      <li>
        Confirm bandwidth isn't overwhelmed, causing high latency.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Network performance</td>
  <td>
    Network performance is comprised of many factors. A significant
    factor is latency, which is the amount of time it takes data to
    travel from one point of the network to another. To improve latency,
    look at:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Increasing or improving bandwidth, which is the size of the
        communication channel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increasing or improving throughput, which is the ability of the
        system to send and receive data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eliminating saturation of bandwidth or throughput. Saturation
        indicates that maximum capacity has been achieved. Exceeding
        that point may result in a bottleneck.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Technologies that may improve latency are:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Remote direct memory access (RDMA) drivers. They provide
        high-throughput, low-latency communication that minimizes CPU
        usage. The drivers quickly transfer the contents of a memory
        buffer to a buffer on a remote system. RDMA drivers use one of
        the following communication standards:
        <ul>
          <li>Infiniband (IB)</li>
          <li>Internet Wide Area RDMA Protocol (iWARP)</li>
          <li>RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Unix sockets instead of localhost. You can improve latency by
        using a Unix domain socket for exchanging data between processes
        executing on the same host operating system. Unix socket
        communication occurs in the operating system kernel. The file
        system is used as the address namespace, and the two processes
        can communicate by opening the same socket.
      </li>
    </ul>

<tr>
  <td><b>ping</b></td>
  <td>
    Verifies connectivity between hosts within the network.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ping a host using its IP address. If there is no response, try
        to ping another host.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If your computer cannot communicate with any other computer,
            check the network cable, the network interface card, or the
            IP address configuration on your computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your computer can communicate with computers on the local
            network, but can't communicate with remote computers (such
            as the internet), verify the default gateway configuration
            on your computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            If all computers on the local network cannot communicate
            with any remote computer, troubleshoot the router's
            connection to the remote network.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Ping a host using its DNS name. If a ping by IP address works,
        but a ping by DNS name fails, there is probably a name
        resolution problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the <b>-c</b> option to specify how many ICMP echo requests
