## 3.3.1 Locale Settings

### Locale Settings 00:00-00:38

When installing a new Linux system, the locality information is configured. Locale information includes language, timezone, text encoding, time, date, and currency formats. While they don't entirely affect the inner workings or the performance of Linux, they do have much to do with displaying text on the screen. In older Linux versions, many of these settings were configured using locale environmental variables. Now they are preconfigured, and only the language used, and its encoding are configured with a variable.

### Locale Details 00:38-01:23

During installation, you're prompted to answer your language preference. When making the language choice, you're also configuring additional locale information. When selecting a region such as the United States or Canada, the number, currency, and measurement settings are configured. When selecting the time format, you're configuring the date and time formats. This is important since there may be more than one language for a given country, and the individual settings for that country may change. Also, most Linux distros have a method to install remote languages and their settings. This helps to make Linux an operating system that the world can use and customize to their region.

### Example: Linux Mint 01:23-01:48

Here's an example of how to set locale settings. Here, in Linux Mint, you can set the Language, Region, Time format, System locale, and Install/Remove Languages in a single point-and-click menu. By clicking and choosing the language and region, all of the other settings for date, time, numbers, etc., are configured.

### Example: Red Hat 01:48-02:25

As you can see here, in Red Hat, the look and feel are much different. Here you have a menu of several system settings to choose from. For Region and Language, there are only two configurable items, Language and Formats. Again, you can choose from several languages and formats to change the locale information.

The primary takeaway is that most Linux distributions have methods to affect how information is displayed on the screen. You can choose from different languages and different display formats. The look and feel may be slightly different, but it's not overly complex.

### Viewing Locale Information 02:25-04:18

When your system was initially installed, the locale information was also configured. To view a list of locale variables, you can issue the locale command to view the variables. Here, using a Red Hat Linux server, you can see the LC variables and their settings. Here you see, they're all the same since everything is configured for English US. The encoding here is UTF-8. All of the US default locale settings are used. In some systems, however, there may be other configurations where most of these values are blank and instead use LC_ALL or the LANG variables.

Locale information is configured differently in different distributions. While not common, you may have to change locale information for a given system. For example, if the system was set up in Canada where English is spoken but gets moved to French Canada, the language must be changed. Or, if a system is created in the UK but gets shipped to Mexico, the language and locale settings must be changed. Using the graphical tools, this is generally not a problem. However, there are text-based tools to help with that, and they differ from distribution to distribution.

Another situation might involve multiple users. Suppose there's a Linux system used by users who require different locale information. One might use the system for entering orders in the US. Another might use the same system to fulfill orders out of Brazil. Each user is using different locale information based on their Linux profile on the same machine. So, while most systems are stationary and use a single locale configuration for the life of the machine, there are situations where changes are needed.

### Convert Encoding 04:18-05:15

As Linux grows in popularity, it's used in more countries with more languages and regions. While most use UTF-8 encoding, some systems may not. Additionally, data may come from other types of systems, including PCs, mainframes, and others. The data you receive may be encoded differently than your system, rendering the data unreadable. The utility program called 'iconv' can be used to convert from one format to another. Here, there are a few parameters that can be used. For example, you can use iconv to convert data from infile.dat using encoding utf-8 to outfile.dat using encoding ebcdic-us. Check your distro to find out whether or not it supports the iconv program.

### Summary 05:15-05:38

For this lesson you learned about locale information and how it affects displaying information on your screen. You learned that the locale and region settings affect text, numbers, data and time formats. You also learned about the locale command and iconv program.

## 3.3.2 Configuring Locale Settings

### Configure Locale Settings 00:00-00:37

In this demo, we're going to configure locale settings. Locale settings are used to localize the shell and sometimes GUI environments. In other words, we make the time, date, currency formats, and language all match the location where we live or work.

For example, in the United States, the monetary system is based on dollars and is represented by a dollar sign ($). But if you live in England, your monetary system is based on the pound and is represented by a pound sign (£). Likewise, if you live in Canada, you might speak French and would probably find it more convenient to view the man pages in your native language.

### Use the locale Command to View Variables 00:37-00:57

Now, locale settings are controlled by environment variables. To view these variables, all you have to do is type locale at the shell prompt. You can see that a list of the various locale environment variables pops up along with their values. LC_TIME is what determines if the time will be shown in a 24-hour or 12-hour format.

### Variable Syntax 00:57-03:11

Each locale environment variable consists of two parts—the variable name followed by the assigned value. Let's see how this system's time is currently configured. When we type date, we see that the date and time are shown in typical US English format. To temporarily change the format to what a French Canadian might see, we begin by typing the name of the variable, LC_TIME, followed by an equal sign.

Everything after the equal sign is the value assigned to that variable. When assigning a value to a variable, first specify the language you want that variable to use. You do this with a language code, such as en for English. To change the language to French, type lowercase fr. It has to be in lowercase because it's based on a standard known as ISO 639.

Next is the country code. This is separated from the language code with an underscore. US would be for the United States and CA for Canada. The country code has to be in uppercase because it's based on another standard called ISO 3166.

Next, add a period followed by the character set. There are several sets available, but UTF-8 is the typical one. And there are also additional options available by putting an @ sign after the character set and including a modifier. The modifier specifies more locale attributes, like a particular dialect or a different currency. The modifier is frequently used in Europe to differentiate between countries that use the euro and those that don't, but still speak the same language.

The L A N G or LANG variable, however, will apply the language settings to all other variables. Once the language is set everywhere, we can change individual variables as needed.

Let's change the LANG variable to German here. We type LANG and use the language code of de, the country code of DE, and the UTF-8 character set. Now we export the variable and view the changes. The German settings have been applied to all the variables.

We can see which variables were inherited from LANG, as they have quotation marks surrounding them. When we enter invalid commands, the error message shows up in German.

### Make Permanent Locale Changes 03:11-04:19

This method only changes the variables temporarily. We use the localectl tool to make changes permanent. Let's see the current settings by typing localectl status. You'll notice that the German language changes were in fact temporary and don't appear here. When we reboot the system, it'll revert to the settings we're looking at now. We can see which language and country codes are available with the localectl list-locales command. Let's reboot the machine to restore the US English default.

Once it's rebooted, we see that the locale settings have reverted back. The default settings are saved in the /etc/default/locale file and can be seen using the cat command. Run cat /etc/default/locale. To make a permanent change, type localectl set-locale and the desired locale setting. Let's use the LANG variable again to change all the variables at once. Type LANG=fr_CA.UTF-8.

### Summary 04:19-04:40

That's it for this demonstration. In this demo, we explored the locale environment variables. We used the locale command to view the system's current environment variables, and we temporarily changed them. We ended by showing you how to permanently set the locale settings with the localectl command.

## 3.3.3 Localization Facts

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Locale overview
- Character sets
- Locale environment variable definitions
- Locale variable precedence rules
- Miscellaneous commands
- Keyboard settings/mappings

### Locale Overview

Linux uses locale environment variables to determine the conventions for the date and time formatting, character display, and other elements. Programs that support this technology use these environment variables accordingly.

Locales:

<ul>
<li>
  Determine the way data is displayed on a computer, including:
  <ul>
    <li>The language and encoding of the text displayed on screen</li>
    <li>Character classes</li>
    <li>Sort order</li>
    <li>Number formatting</li>
    <li>Currency type and format</li>
    <li>Date and time display</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Use configuration files that are part of the system library. On most
  distributions these are located in
  <b>/usr/share/locale</b>.
</li>
<li>
  Use language codes specified in ISO-639 and country codes specified in
  ISO-3166.
</li>
<li>
  Use the format <b>localectl</b>
  <b><i>option</i> <i>assignment</i></b>
  (such as <b></b>
  <i><b>language_COUNTRY.charsets</b> ) <br /></i>
  Note: The language (such as en for English) must be in all lowercase,
  while the COUNTRY (such as GB for Great Britain) must be in all
  uppercase.

        <div>
          <span>
            As an alternative, you can first temporarily change the
            environment variable and then make it permanent using the
            export command. For example, to set the same LC_CTYPE command,
            you would complete the following: <br /><br />#
            LC_CTYPE="fr_CA.UTF-8" <br /># export LC_CTYPE
            </span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</li>
</ul>

### Locale Environment Variable Definitions

The following table lists the configurable environment variables used to control a Linux system's locale:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Variable name</th>
    <th>Explanation</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>LANG</td>
    <td>
      Defines all locale settings at once while allowing further
      individual customization via the
      <b class="fw-bold">LC_*</b> settings. When this variable is set to
      <b class="fw-bold">LANG=C</b> , programs will display their output
      without passing it through locale translations. This is helpful when
      the output is being corrupted by the locale and helps avoid some
      types of problems.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_CTYPE</td>
    <td>
      Defines the character handling properties for the computer. This
      determines whether characters are recognized as alphabetical,
      numeric, etc. This also determines the character set used (if
      applicable).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_MESSAGES</td>
    <td>
      Specifies localizations for applications that use a message-based
      localization scheme.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_COLLATE</td>
    <td>
      Defines the alphabetical ordering of strings (for example, the
      output of sorted directory listings).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_NUMERIC</td>
    <td>
      Controls formatting for numeric values that are not monetary (for
      example, which character to use as the thousands separator and the
      decimal separator).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_MONETARY</td>
    <td>
      Identifies currency units and formatting of currency type and
      numeric values.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_TIME</td>
    <td>
      Defines formatting for dates and times, such as whether to use a
      24-hour clock versus a 12-hour clock.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_PAPER</td>
    <td>
      Designates the default paper size (for example, US letter versus
      A4).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_NAME</td>
    <td>
      Denotes personal name format (for example, whether the surname comes
      first or last).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_ADDRESS</td>
    <td>Specifies address formatting.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_TELEPHONE</td>
    <td>Defines telephone number format.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_MEASUREMENT</td>
    <td>Determines which measurement units are used.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LANGUAGE</td>
    <td>Overrides the LC_MESSAGES settings.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LC_ALL</td>
    <td>
      Sets all locales to the same setting. This is used for overriding
      all other settings.
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### localectl list-locales

If the locale is not available, install the desired language set.

> In most cases, your system will need to be restarted before the permanent changes made using the localectl command can be used.

### Locale Variable Precedence Rules

Not all of the LC\_ environment variables have the same level of precedence. Linux uses the following rules to determine which locale settings to use. This helps determine what to do if conflicting values are placed in the locale variables.

### Precedence Rules

<ol><li>If the LC_ALL variable is defined (non-null), its value is used, and the values assigned to all other LC_ variables are not checked.</li>
<li>If the LC_ALL variable is undefined (null), the specific LC_ variable in question is checked. If the specific LC_ variable has a value, it is used.</li>
<li>If the LC variable in question has a null value, the LANG environment variable is used.</li></ol>

### Miscellaneous Commands

The following table describes a few additional locale related commands and options.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>echo</b></td>
    <td>
      From a shell prompt (terminal), the echo command can be used to view
      the current locale settings, if one has been set. This is
      accomplished by typing <b>echo</b> followed by a dollar sign (
      <b>$</b> ) and then the name of the environment variable that you
      want to view. <br />Example:
      <b>echo $LC_CTYPE</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>locale</b></td>
    <td>
      From a shell prompt (terminal), this command displays the current
      locale settings for the computer.
      <p>
        If the option shown has quotes, it is obtaining the setting by
        inheritance. Settings without quotes are explicitly assigned.
      </p>

          options which are available for use.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The locale command is located in /usr/bin.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>iconv</b></td>
    <td>
      The iconv program reads input text using one type of encoding and
      outputs the text using another encoding type. If no input file is
      provided, or if it is given as a dash (-), iconv reads from the
      standard input. If no output file is given, iconv writes to the
      standard output.
      <p>Converts encoding from one encoding type to another.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>-f</b> specifies the old encoding type.</li>
