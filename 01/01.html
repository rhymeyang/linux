When Linux was first introduced in the early 1990s, it was hardly noticed. Professionals in the industry at the time were focused on the big operating systems of the day: Microsoft Windows, Novell Netware, macOS, and Unix. Since that time, things have changed dramatically. Linux is now seen worldwide in the server rooms of most major organizations. It&#39;s also started to show up more and more in the desktop market as well. That&#39;s because there are tons of Linux applications available, and most of them are free. There&#39;s growing demand for network administrators who can implement, maintain, and support Linux systems.</p><h3 id="linux-components-00-40-01-30" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-components-00-40-01-30"><span>Linux Components 00:40-01:30</span></a></h3><p>Now, the Linux OS has several components that make it unique. The kernel is the operating system&#39;s core, managing each hardware element with corresponding software. Linux libraries are collections of pre-written elements made so that programmers can perform specific functions without writing their own code. Imagine that you&#39;re a computer programmer writing an application. You have to write code that allows it to work with every type of hardware that&#39;s ever existed. But using libraries, it doesn&#39;t matter which type of hardware is installed. You call the appropriate library, and it does the rest to ensure compatibility. Okay, now let&#39;s get into interfaces.</p><p>Linux provides two different user interfaces. The first—called a graphical user interface, or GUI—looks a great deal like other operating systems that you&#39;re used to. Linux also provides a text-based command line interface. This is going to be the focus of this course since most core functions of Linux are performed there.</p><h3 id="linux-history-01-30-02-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-history-01-30-02-29"><span>Linux History 01:30-02:29</span></a></h3><p>Now, the first version of Linux was very minimal in nature. When it was released in 1991, it consisted of the Linux kernel and three basic utilities: the Bash shell, an update utility, and a compiler to write your own basic programs. Linus Torvalds, the original developer of the kernel, posted the source code for Linux online for free. With that one move, Torvalds changed the way operating systems are developed. Other programmers were welcome to create their own version. There was no secrecy, developer dominance, or limitations.</p><p>This collaborative development project continued for several years until 1994, when Linux version 1.0 was finally ready for release. The continued open-source development model has resulted in Linux being widely used around the world with over 300 regularly maintained versions. The idea behind this was that allowing programmers around the world to modify an application&#39;s source code would produce higher-quality software. Software developed with this model is frequently referred to as free or open-source software.</p><h3 id="gnu-s-not-unix-02-29-03-28" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gnu-s-not-unix-02-29-03-28"><span>GNU&#39;s Not Unix 02:29-03:28</span></a></h3><p>The Linux kernel itself is licensed under a General Public License, or GPL, with the key point being that the kernel remains freely available to anyone who wants it. You can download the Linux kernel source code, you can modify it, re-compile it, and you can run it. You can even create your own custom version, which would be called a Linux distribution. This idea of sharing source code is something that&#39;s spearheaded by the GNU foundation. GNU, by the way, is a recursive acronym for GNU&#39;s Not Unix.</p><p>The best way to think of all Linux distributions is to compare them to ice cream. Ice cream comes in a wide variety of flavors, right? But the basic formula has stayed the same. Most ice cream is made from cream, milk, sugar, and eggs. Companies that sell ice cream take this basic recipe and customize it by adding in other ingredients. Linux distributions work in much the same way. The kernel source code is comparable to the basic ice cream recipe. Because the source code is openly distributed, programmers are free to experiment with it and come up with something new.</p><h3 id="linux-distributions-03-28-04-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-distributions-03-28-04-12"><span>Linux Distributions 03:28-04:12</span></a></h3><p>Just as ice cream companies add ingredients to the ice cream recipe, programmers can enhance the Linux source code by adding specialized tools. They can even write new applications for the operating system. The result is an entirely new distribution.</p><p>And there are many, many different Linux distributions available. Programmers around the world have published theirs online. Some have developed powerful tools suited for high-end networking. Others might&#39;ve been made to run productivity applications on an end user&#39;s desktop. Either way, the result is a customized user experience. Today, there are literally hundreds of different distributions available. Some of the most popular ones are SUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat, Oracle Linux, Debian, and CentOS. Which one works best for you will depend on your needs.</p><h3 id="summary-04-12-04-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-12-04-29"><span>Summary 04:12-04:29</span></a></h3><p>And that&#39;s it for this lesson. We talked about what Linux is and how it came to be. We also went into the components that make up the Linux operating system. And then we ended this lesson by talking about the concept of a distribution.</p><h2 id="_1-1-2-linux-implementations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-1-2-linux-implementations"><span>1.1.2 Linux Implementations</span></a></h2><h3 id="linux-implementations-00-00-00-32" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-implementations-00-00-00-32"><span>Linux Implementations 00:00-00:32</span></a></h3><p>Linux is an operating system unlike most. Other OSes are often developed by for-profit organizations and have proprietary codes that make them desirable. On the other hand, Linux is developed based on the GPL or GNU Public License, meaning the Linux OS source code is freely distributable. This allows eyes from all over the world to analyze Linux and improve it.</p><p>Linux can also be configured to run as a desktop, server, and embedded system. In this lesson, we&#39;re going to review these and other Linux topics.</p><h3 id="linux-usage-00-32-01-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-usage-00-32-01-11"><span>Linux Usage 00:32-01:11</span></a></h3><p>Linux is a very stable operating system and works on various platforms. For desktop systems, hundreds of distributions called distros can be downloaded at no cost. You can even download the complete operating system source code. Further, Linux has been tested against other operating systems, and Linux performed either as well or better than most other Oses. Lastly, considering the OS cost, renewals, and other factors, Linux is much more economical, considering it rarely charges for per-seat licensing.</p><p>It&#39;s important to note that Linux doesn&#39;t require the fastest or most robust hardware to run well. Granted, should a high-performance system be required, the hardware costs between Linux and other OSes will be the same.</p><h3 id="linux-as-a-desktop-os-01-11-03-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-as-a-desktop-os-01-11-03-01"><span>Linux as a Desktop OS 01:11-03:01</span></a></h3><p>There are hundreds of Linux distributions that vary in their size and include applications. Most are generic and have similar functionality, such as web browsers, email clients, and office suites. Others are more customized for functions such as web developer, multimedia applications, and cybersecurity. There are two divisions among distributions: the Red Hat and Debian variant. While the underlying core of Linux remains the same, how the Linux system is built determines the variant. Further, the applications included help to define the distribution. Red Hat variants include Fedora and Rocky. Debian variants include Ubuntu, Kali, and Mint. There are still others, such as SUSE /openSUSE and Arch.</p><p>There are hundreds of software titles on each of these systems that can be downloaded at no cost. These include Libre Office and Open Office — compatible office suites; VLC Media player; GIMP — and GNU Image Manipulation Program that has similar functions to those found in Photoshop; and even compatible versions of the Chrome and Firefox browsers.</p><p>The Linux OS accounts for about 3% of the worldwide market share, while Windows commands about 75%. Most business desktops are standardized on the Windows OS, and they account for the large disparity between adopting a Desktop OS. Further, Linux is still looked at as a hobbyist OS with little standardization. Those that use Linux understand the versatility of Linux and the myriad of software titles that are available for the cost of a simple download. But there&#39;s no one organization that &quot;owns&quot; Linux, and many more people understand and can support the Windows OS. For organizations to standardize on Linux, they&#39;d have to change corporate culture and, potentially, leave the comfort zone of a known and proven reliable OS. Also, configuration, setup, and management are more of a manual task with Linux. However, Linux is a much better option when considering implementation, acquisition, and renewal costs.</p><h3 id="linux-as-a-server-os-03-01-03-57" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-as-a-server-os-03-01-03-57"><span>Linux as a Server OS 03:01-03:57</span></a></h3><p>Things are a bit different when it comes to utilizing Linux as a server OS. Linux is used in several specialized industries, such as space missions, websites, special effects, smartphones, etc. In general, Linux is used about 45% of the time. A Linux server is simply the same core operating system as the Linux desktop with additional server software such as DHCP, DNS, web server, database, and more. The most widely used web server software, Apache, is often deployed on Linux. MySQL and Postgres are two of the most popular database engines.</p><p>Linux can be configured with modularity, so it only runs the items required for the server role. It does this well and better than most other OSes making it very efficient and relatively easy to configure. It works just as well in different roles, such as an email server, file and print, and super-computer, and it works well with other OSes. It adapts well and can be configured to utilize its own or other authentication mechanisms.</p><h3 id="linux-on-mobile-devices-03-57-04-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-on-mobile-devices-03-57-04-41"><span>Linux on Mobile Devices 03:57-04:41</span></a></h3><p>As we&#39;ve learned, Linux can run on systems as either a workstation or a server. Linux also runs on mobile devices such as tablets and cellular phones. The Android OS developed by Google has an approximate 72% market share of the mobile OS market. There are a few reasons why Android is the market leader. First, since Linux has little to no cost, the Android OS has a low-cost point. The Linux kernel itself doesn&#39;t require much power from the CPU and has a low reliance on RAM, making it very efficient with limited resources. Lastly, there&#39;s tremendous app support. You can run almost any available app on the Android OS. The app costs are generally lower than comparable apps on other mobile devices. All in all, Android offers a lot of power in a small package.</p><h3 id="linux-virtualization-04-41-07-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-virtualization-04-41-07-29"><span>Linux Virtualization 04:41-07:29</span></a></h3><p>With normal operation, a PC usually uses less than 10% of its available resources. This is especially true with systems that utilize multi-core processors. Also, most users only run a few programs simultaneously, leaving the system&#39;s RAM largely unused. This allows your computer system to utilize more of its resources. One method you can use without any additional cost is virtualization. Virtualization has been around for many years and is the basis for cloud computing. Without it, we&#39;d require a single computer for every server task within an enterprise. That would take up quite a bit of space, generate a lot of heat, and a huge capital for maintenance, operating, and air conduction—not to mention support. Virtualization provides a greater use for the resources already owned and makes everything run more efficiently.</p><p>Using the conventional concept, without computer virtualization, the system&#39;s operating system is installed on the computer system consuming all of the processor, memory, and other system resources. Once installed, applications are installed such as a browser, word processor, email viewer, etc. Then, your data is stored on the system&#39;s internal storage. This is how most users use their computer system. There&#39;s a single piece of hardware with an operating system installed on the internal storage, and applications and data are also stored there. This is fine for most users. However, this isn&#39;t very efficient if you have a greater need.</p><p>When adding virtualization, the picture changes. Rather than installing the operating system directly on the hardware, another piece of software is installed. This software is called a hypervisor. The hypervisor is used as a middleman between the computer resources and the operating systems installed virtually.</p><p>Remember, too, that all of the computer resources are shared among all the installed virtual machines. This includes the processor, RAM, storage, NICs, and I/O. Also, there are several different hypervisors in use today. Xen and KVM are often included with most Linux distributions and are open source. VirtualBox is often used on Windows and Mac machines but is also available on Linux and Solaris and is also open source. VMware is proprietary software. It&#39;s not open source. It&#39;s used in data centers worldwide and has about 40% of the world market.</p><p>When the hypervisor is installed and configured, one or more operating systems can be installed on the system. You can have multiple copies of the same operating system, such as Windows, or different operating systems, like Windows, Rocky Linux, and OpenSUSE Linux. Each virtual machine works independently from the other, and all can run simultaneously as long as the computer system doesn&#39;t run out of system resources. Each virtual machine acts as if it was the only operating system installed and is, typically, unaware it&#39;s running virtually. The data on each virtual machine remains encapsulated within its own machine and isn&#39;t shared with other virtual machines.</p><h3 id="cloud-computing-07-29-09-50" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cloud-computing-07-29-09-50"><span>Cloud Computing 07:29-09:50</span></a></h3><p>Virtualization provides key benefits to organizations. It uses resources much more efficiently and reduces the time it takes to order new hardware, wait for delivery, then install and configure the machine from weeks to hours.</p><p>Virtualization is also the basis for cloud computing. With cloud computing, the hardware, software, and/or network resources we&#39;ve historically implemented locally and on-site are now implemented using your systems network connection. You&#39;re using the resources of another company to host your computing needs. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are two examples of this technology. You no longer purchase servers and no longer need to provide rack space, power, cooling, or maintenance on equipment. Instead, you utilize these services over the internet. The cloud services provider is now responsible for all the costs traditionally borne by your organization. You pay them for providing you with these services.</p><p>New terms have emerged and are now part of most companies&#39; vernacular. The first is IaaS or Infrastructure as a server. This is the typical model of servers and services provided to an organization. The cloud provider takes over those services and replaces traditional server rooms. Next is SaaS or software as a service. Rather than installing applications on a user&#39;s desktop, the software is provided by the service provider using a web browser. Google and Microsoft offer these services with their shared applications and office suites via web delivery. Naas, or Network as a service, provides network connectivity through the cloud. STaaS provides storage as a service. Several internet providers offer cloud storage using different methods and hosting various capacities. There&#39;s also DaaS which provides a Desktop as a Service. This is useful for organizations that utilize terminals rather than computers for desktop delivery. PaaS or platform as a service model provides an integrated solution to accomplish a specific task and may combine many other services described here.</p><p>Cloud computing has opened a whole host of opportunities for organizations. They now have the freedom to choose the model they&#39;re most comfortable with—the conventional model—where all of the server and infrastructure equipment is on-premise, goes completely into the cloud, and has the provider supply all the computing resources as a service; or, you can choose to do both and adopt a hybrid solution. The cloud isn&#39;t all or nothing and can be molded into providing computing resources in a manner you both want and are comfortable with. In addition, it can add redundancy, disaster recovery, and business continuity.</p><h3 id="embedded-linux-09-50-10-27" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#embedded-linux-09-50-10-27"><span>Embedded Linux 09:50-10:27</span></a></h3><p>Linux is everywhere as long as you know where to look. Keeping in mind that Linux is a modular operating system, you can remove all the parts that aren&#39;t needed. For example, in an embedded system, there&#39;s often no need for a customer interface. The Linux kernel has a very small footprint, perfect for embedding into a system&#39;s hardware. Intelligent devices such as televisions, IoT devices, Home internet routers, microwave ovens, etc. If you&#39;ve watched a movie or played a game aboard a plane, it was probably controlled and delivered using Linux. By removing all the unneeded components from Linux, the remaining kernel and interface are loaded onto an electronics chip and placed onto the device controller.</p><h3 id="summary-10-27-10-48" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-10-27-10-48"><span>Summary 10:27-10:48</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed the different roles that Linux can play in a typical organization. We talked about using Linux on servers, desktops, and mobile platforms. We also talked about using Linux as a hypervisor. We ended this lesson by talking about embedded Linux and cloud computing.</p><h2 id="_1-1-3-linux-introduction-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-1-3-linux-introduction-facts"><span>1.1.3 Linux Introduction Facts</span></a></h2><p>Linux has become a major player in computer networking and plays a vital role for servers and desktops—it even works with mobile devices. Understanding the origin of Linux and how it has evolved to its prominent place in the industry is an important part of your training.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Linux development history</li><li>Linux expansion and growth</li><li>Linux operating system overview</li><li>Linux key components</li><li>Linux distributions</li><li>Other Linux implementations</li></ul><h3 id="linux-development-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-development-history"><span>Linux Development History</span></a></h3><p>The Linux operating system had its start in 1991 when, as a graduate student at Finland&#39;s University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds began a project that later became the Linux kernel. Linus based his version of Linux on a Unix-like system named MINIX, which was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum. Linux version 0.02 was released in October of 1991 and consisted of the Linux kernel and its three basic utilities. These were:</p><ul><li>A Bash shell providing a command line interface.</li><li>An update utility used for flushing the file system buffers.</li><li>A GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) compiler system allowing an individual to write their own programs.</li></ul><p>The source code for the Linux operating system was shared as freeware on the internet, and others were encouraged to enhance it and make it better. At this point, Linux took on a life of its own, and it became a worldwide collaborative development project with no secrecy or tightly guarded copyrights. Access to the source code was open to anyone who wanted it. This collaborative development project on Linux continued for several years until 1994, when Linux version 1.0 was released.</p><p>The Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which requires the source code to remain freely available to anybody who wants it. GNU is a recursive acronym for &quot;GNU&#39;s Not Unix!&quot;</p><h3 id="linux-expansion-and-growth" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-expansion-and-growth"><span>Linux Expansion and Growth</span></a></h3><p>When Linux was first released, it was considered an experimental operating system. So it was something that you might experiment within a lab, but probably never consider putting into a production environment. Since that time, things have changed dramatically, and Linux is now a mainstay operating system, especially in server rooms. Using the wide variety of network services that are now available for the Linux operating system, you can configure it to perform almost any networking role that any competing server operating system can perform, including as a:</p><ul><li><p class="MsoNormal"> File server</p></li><li><p class="MsoNormal"> Print server</p></li><li><p class="MsoNormal"> Database server</p></li><li><p class="MsoNormal"> Web server</p></li><li><p class="MsoNormal"> Email server</p></li></ul><p>Linux is also slowly becoming more popular as a desktop operating system due to the many applications that are currently available. Many of these applications are free.</p><p>A few desktop application examples include:</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Application</th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>LibreOffice</td><td>A free office software suite for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations.</td></tr><tr><td>Apache OpenOffice</td><td>A free office software suite for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations.</td></tr><tr><td>GIMP</td><td>GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a free and open-source image editor,similar to Photoshop.</td></tr><tr><td>LightWorks</td><td>An editing tool available in free and for-purchase versions.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="linux-operating-system-overview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-operating-system-overview"><span>Linux Operating System Overview</span></a></h3><p>As an operating system, Linux provides the following key functions of a computer:</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Function</th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Application platform</td><td>The operating system provides a platform where applications can run.</td></tr><tr><td>Hardware interface</td><td>A key function of the operating system is to ensure that one application running on the system does not try to use an area in memory that&#39;s already in use by another application. It is also responsible for ensuring that a given application running on the system does not monopolize the CPU time so that other applications running on the system cannot use the CPU.</td></tr><tr><td>Data storage</td><td>The operating system is responsible for providing an efficient and reliable means for storing data. This is usually done using some type of storage device, like a hard disk drive formatted with a particular file system. The file system&#39;s job is to organize the information on the hard disk in an easily retrievable format.</td></tr><tr><td>Security</td><td>The operating system is responsible for providing some degree of security for the data that&#39;s stored on its storage devices. For example, the system administrator can create rules and assign permissions that determine who can access what information on the system.</td></tr><tr><td>Network connectivity</td><td>The operating system provides some type of connectivity between computer systems over a network connection. They can do this using a variety of different network media and interfaces, such as an Ethernet connection between computer systems. There are other standards that can be used to create network connections, such as mobile broadband wireless or Wi-Fi wireless.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="linux-key-components" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-key-components"><span>Linux Key Components</span></a></h3><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Component</th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Linux kernel <br> (operating system)</td><td>The Linux kernel is the core of the Linux operating system. It is the actual operating system itself. Linux also provides libraries. Libraries contain pre-written code elements that programmers can use, such as how to interface with a hard disk. For example, when a programmer needs to write data to a hard disk, he or she does not need to know whether the machine has a SATA, IDE, or SCSI drive installed. Instead, the programmer simply calls the appropriate library and tells the operating system that it needs to write data to whatever storage device is installed in the system, and then the operating system takes care of the rest using its libraries.</td></tr><tr><td>Utilities</td><td>The Linux operating system includes a wide variety of utilities that can complete operating system management tasks, such as creating files and maintaining file systems, editing text files, managing the applications that are running on the system, installing new applications on the system, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>User interfaces</td><td>The Linux operating system provides the end user with a means of interacting with the operating system, the user interface. <p>Linux provides two different user interfaces:</p><ul><li>Graphical user interface: a Linux graphical user interface (GUI) is similar to the GUIs used in other operating systems, such as Windows. When a user wants to complete some task, they can click on buttons or navigate through menus to accomplish the desired task. <br><br></li><li style="list-style:none;"><img src="https://cdn.testout.com/_version_6015/linuxpro2022v6-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_linux_intro_facts_lp6/linux_gui.jpg" alt="A Linux graphical user interface"><br></li><li>Text-based command line interfaces: a text-based interface (often referred to as a terminal or shell) provides a place where the user can type commands. This is similar to Windows Command Prompt and PowerShell. Linux system administrator needs to know how to perform tasks from the text-based interface because most Linux servers disable the graphical user interface to better utilize the systems memory and processor. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.testout.com/_version_6015/linuxpro2022v6-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_linux_intro_facts_lp6/linux_text_ui.jpg" alt="A Linux text-based command line interface or terminal window"></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="linux-distributions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-distributions"><span>Linux Distributions</span></a></h3><p>Simply put, a Linux distribution (also known as a distro) is a unique compilation of the Linux kernel, utilities, desktop environments, applications, and more.</p><p>Since the Linux operating system is not produced by a single organization, different organizations combine the desired components they want to use, sometimes creating their own unique features. Then they compile them into their own flavor of a Linux operating system or distribution. This distribution is then often made available at no cost or, in some cases (usually for server versions of Linux), for a fee. Individuals can also create their own distribution, but the process of compiling the software can be time consuming, and it is difficult to make all of the different programs work together properly.</p><p>There are hundreds of distributions available. Some of the most popular include:</p><ul><li>Mint</li><li>Ubuntu</li><li>Debian</li><li>Fedora</li><li>openSUSE</li><li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</li><li>Oracle</li><li>CentOS</li></ul><h3 id="other-linux-implementations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#other-linux-implementations"><span>Other Linux Implementations</span></a></h3><p>Linux is also useful in the following implementations:</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Implementation</th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Linux on mobile devices</td><td>Linux has nearly taken over the mobile device market in the form of the Android operating system. The current Android operating system is a specialized Linux distribution created by Google. It was designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers. <p>Android benefits include:</p><ul><li>Cost—since Android is based on the Linux kernel, it is much less expensive than other mobile device operating systems, like iOS or Windows RT.</li><li>Performance—android performs extremely well on mobile devices.</li><li>Application support—there are many apps available for Android devices. In most cases, these apps allow Android devices the ability to provide the same functionality as the more expensive devices from Apple and Microsoft.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Linux virtualization</td><td>Virtualization is the ability to install and run multiple operating systems concurrently on a single physical machine. This is typically accomplished using a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a thin layer of software that resides between the guest operating system and the hardware. A hypervisor allows virtual machines to interact with the hardware without going through the host operating system. The Linux operating system can be virtualized. <p>A key benefit of virtualization is a more efficient use of system resources. All of the available computing capacity of the system hardware is allocated and distributed among all the virtual machines running on the system. Another benefit of virtualization is the ability to run multiple platforms at the same time. For example, you can run Windows at the same time that you are running Linux. This can be a real benefit for Linux software developers and testers. It also makes it much easier to test how an application being developed will perform on different platforms or different versions of a given operating system.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Linux and cloud computing</td><td>In cloud computing, the hardware, software, and/or network resources that have historically been implemented on-site are moved offsite. When a new Linux system is required, you can use an internet cloud provider to deploy the new Linux virtual machine using a hypervisor at their site. You then pay that provider a fee to access this virtual machine through your organization&#39;s network connection. This process is referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). <p>Other cloud computing options for Linux include:</p><ul><li>Software as a Service (SaaS), which provides access to software and data through the cloud.</li><li>Network as a Service (NaaS), which provides network connectivity through the cloud.</li><li>Storage as a Service (STaaS), which provides access to storage devices through the cloud. <br></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Embedded Linux</td><td>Embedded Linux is the process of embedding Linux within intelligent devices, such as automation and control equipment, smart TVs, smartphones, and tablets. To accomplish this, the operating system is customized so that it only provides the functions required by that particular device, and all the remaining unnecessary elements of the Linux kernel are removed. Once that&#39;s done, the kernel itself is embedded in flash memory chips on the given device.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="_1-1-4-server-roles-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-1-4-server-roles-facts"><span>1.1.4 Server Roles Facts</span></a></h2><p>This lesson covers Linux server roles.</p><h3 id="linux-server-roles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-server-roles"><span>Linux Server Roles</span></a></h3><p>As a result of the continued popularity, growth, and development of Linux, it can now fulfill many server roles. In most cases, a server role is an application or process installed on a Linux server. In some cases, a Linux server may be dedicated to run or fulfill a single server role. While at other times, several server roles may be functioning on the same server.</p><p>The following table summarizes and explains several of the Linux server roles.</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Role</th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>NTP</td><td>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time on your Linux system with a centralized NTP server. A local NTP server on the network can be synchronized with an external timing source to keep all the servers in your organization in sync with an accurate time. NTP uses a hierarchy of clocks and computers for synchronizing the current time. <p>NTP uses stepping to quickly make large adjustments to close wide time discrepancies, usually about once every 60 seconds. For example, if there&#39;s a big differential between the provider&#39;s time and the time on your local system, NTP will adjust the time on your local system in small increments until the time eventually becomes synchronized.</p></td></tr><tr><td>SSH</td><td>SSH (Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell) is a protocol used to securely log onto remote systems using encryption. SSH is the most common way to access a remote Linux system. OpenSSH is an open source implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and implemented by default on most Linux distributions. <p>Two major components include the SSH client and the SSH server. The SSH client is a program that is typically only run as needed. Once installed, the SSH server is a daemon that constantly runs in the background.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Web server</td><td>A web server is the program responsible for accepting HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests from web browsers or clients and, in turn, sending the clients the files that form webpages. For example, webpages often consist of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents and linked objects, such as images. A machine that has been dedicated to performing this role is also called a web server. <p>A few examples of Linux web server implementations include:</p><ul><li>Apache server</li><li>Nginx</li><li>Lighttpd</li><li>Apache Tomcat</li><li>Monkey HTTP Daemon</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Certificate authority</td><td>A digital certificate is an electronic document that can be used as proof of identification. For example, digital certificates are used between an end user and a bank to establish a trusted connection. As an end user, we trust digital certificates because they are created by trusted entities, called certificate authorities (CAs). A few of the most public certificate authorities include GeoTrust, Comodo, Digicert, Thawte, Verisign and GoDaddy. These CAs require the person or company applying for a certificate (such as your bank) to provide documents and information that proves they are who they claim to be. <p>At times, you may find that using digital certificates within your own organization can be beneficial. For example, when using VPNs, you could use a digital certificate for authentication instead of a pre-shared key. Digital certificates could also be useful for development and staging systems. Rather than paying a public certificate authority for digital certificates for your internal needs, you can configure a Linux system to be a certification authority. One method of doing this is to use OpenSSL, a free open-source library.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Name server</td><td>A name server resolves (or maps) the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), such as www.TestOut.com, to their respective IP addresses, and IP addresses to their respective FQDNs. For example, this lets a user access the TestOut site from their web browser by entering https://www.TestOut.com instead of something like https://104.16.32.53. <p>In many cases, you need to download and install a name resolver software on your Linux system to enable the name server features. The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software is an example of one of the most widely used DNS software on the internet.</p></td></tr><tr><td>DHCP</td><td>The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol (DHCP) centralizes IP address assignment management by allowing a server (such as a Linux server) to dynamically assign IP addresses to clients. DHCP also allows users who move from network to network to easily obtain an IP address appropriate for the subnet they are connected to. The DHCP server and the client use broadcasts to communicate with each other. In many cases, you need to download and install the DHCP server software. For example, for an Ubuntu server, enter:<br><b class="fw-bold">$ sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server</b> at the command prompt.<i class="fs-italicize"><br></i>Configuration of the server can then be completed as needed.</td></tr><tr><td>SNMP</td><td>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is designed for managing complex networks, and is used to communicate with and monitor network devices, servers, and more by means of the IP protocol. SNMP lets network hosts exchange configuration and status information. For example, SNMP can be used to remotely retrieve the operational statistics of a router or firewall. On a Linux machine, SNMP runs as a daemon. In many cases, you need to download and install SNMP. For example, to install SNMP on a CentOS system ,enter:<br><b class="fw-bold">yum -y install net-snmp net-snmp-utils</b> at the command prompt.</td></tr><tr><td>File servers</td><td>A Linux file server is a machine that has been set up and configured to let other machines store and retrieve files to and from a central location. In addition, using a file server can simplify backups and security. Using SMB shares and a variety of programs such as Samba or Network File System, a Linux file server can share files with other Linux systems, as well as with non-Linux systems, such as Windows and Mac.</td></tr><tr><td>Authentication server</td><td>Most enterprise networks require centralized user authentication and access controls for all system resources. This is not only convenient for users, but also allows an administrator to monitor and audit user types and the type of access they have on each machine. It also makes provisioning and disabling user accounts easier. <p>Linux centralized authentication (an authentication server) can be accomplished in many ways, depending on the Linux distribution being used. Some options include installing and using OpenLDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or purchasing programs that aid in the installation and management of centralized authentication, such as FreeIPA Identity &amp; Access Manager.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Proxy</td><td>A proxy is a computer that provides indirect internet access to the computers in your network. In most cases, a proxy server is installed on the same computer as the firewall. Proxy servers provide increased performance and security by blocking direct access between two networks, such as the corporate network and the internet. Proxy can be configured in a variety of ways, such as using SSH tunneling or installing an app on a system that has been configured as a web server.</td></tr><tr><td>Logging</td><td>An important Linux role is the ability to capture a timeline of events that have taken place on the computer in the form of a file, which is referred to as a log file. The process of creating these logs is known as logging. Logging is enabled by default, and logs are often captured for such things as services, the Linux operating system, and applications. Logging is useful for troubleshooting, security, and evaluating server performance. You can configure a centralized logging server, making it easier to evaluate and use the logs created on many systems. Although log files can be stored in a variety of places, most are stored in the /var/log directory or a subdirectory thereof.</td></tr><tr><td>Containers</td><td>Linux containers give you the ability to run an application (with all of the necessary libraries, dependencies, and files) in an isolated environment known as an image or container. Due to this isolation, multiple containers can be run on the same host without affecting each other or the main operating system. All containers utilize and share the same operating system kernel of the host machine, making them very lightweight and fast. <p>Containers are highly portable. When you move or copy a container from one host to another, all of the files and changes necessary to run the applications within the container are moved or copied with it. Moving a container to a new host does not impact the host operating system. Although Linux containers are extremely portable, they must be compatible with the underlying system. For example, x86 Linux systems run x86 containers while ARM Linux systems only run ARM Linux containers. However, an x86 Linux system cannot run an ARM Linux container.</p></td></tr><tr><td>VPN</td><td>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) can be installed on a Linux host and is a type of network that uses encryption to allow IP traffic to travel securely over the TCP/IP network. A VPN is primarily used to support secure communications over an untrusted network (for example, connecting two remote site by means of the internet).</td></tr><tr><td>Monitoring</td><td>Monitoring refers to the process of monitoring the essential Linux services, including operating system metrics, process state, logs, service state, and file system usage. It also refers to monitoring servers&#39; availability. Depending on the Linux distribution, monitoring information can often be gathered manually using command line monitoring tools, such as <b class="fw-bold">top</b>, <b class="fw-bold">lsof</b>, <b class="fw-bold">tcdump</b>, and <b class="fw-bold">vmstat</b>. Web-based utilities (such as Monit and Nagios) can also be installed, which usually provides some type of user interface that makes seeing and analyzing the information easier.</td></tr><tr><td>Database</td><td>A database is a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways. In simpler terms, a database is an organized collection of various forms of data. The information stored in a database is typically organized into rows, columns, and tables. Database information is also indexed to make it easier to find the information required. Many open-source databases are available for Linux, which allow you to manage large chunks of data in a secure way with high performance abilities. Many versions of Linux databases can be installed on your Linux system, such as MySQL, Apache Derby, and PostgreSQL.</td></tr><tr><td>Print server</td><td>A print server is used when a company wants to make a printer available to multiple users over a network. Print servers accept the print jobs from the users and stores them in a queue. When the appropriate printer is available, the job is sent from the queue to the printer. In addition, a print server makes printer queue and status information available to end users and network administrators. <p>The Common UNIX Printing System, or CUPS, is the most common Linux printing system in use today. CUPS manages print jobs and queues and provides network printing using the standard Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).</p></td></tr><tr><td>Mail server</td><td>A mail server is a computer that sends, receives, and stores email for users. <p>When a user creates an email, he or she does so using a mail user agent (MUA) (such as Evolution, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Mutt). The MUA must be configured to send and receive mail by means of a mail server or a Linux system where the mail transfer agent (MTA) has been installed. It is the MTA’s responsibility to then either save the message so it can be downloaded by another local user or, using the internet, send the email to the destination MTA where it will be stored for download by the intended user.</p><p>Some Linux distribution may have a default MTA that can be configured and used. If one does not exist or you want to use a different email system, other MTAs can be downloaded and installed. A few common MTAs include Postfix and Qmail.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Load balancer</td><td>When a company has back-end servers that receive a significant amount of traffic (such as Netfilx, Hulu, or Airbnb), response time to these servers can be increased through load balancers by distributing the workload across the available servers. <p>Although load balancers can be purchased as a hardware appliance, software can be installed on a Linux server, making it a load balancer.
