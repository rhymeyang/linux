The accessibility options are sometimes labeled Universal Access or Assistive Technologies. And even on the same distribution, different desktops display different options. But the concepts we cover will help you determine how to configure any Linux system&#39;s accessibility options.</p><p>Universal Access 00:38-01:14 On many modern end user systems, the Universal Access feature is enabled by default, and you can access it from the logon screen by clicking the accessibility icon, here.</p><p>Then you can set which accessibility options you want to turn on or off.</p><p>This menu is also available after you log on.</p><p>If the accessibility icon isn&#39;t available, you can often find accessibility options in the Settings dialog. You can also use the Search field to look for ‘Universal Access.&#39;</p><p>After you open the Universal Access menu, you can enable or disable features using ON/OFF buttons.</p><p>The first category we&#39;re going to cover is Seeing.</p><p>Seeing – High Contrast 01:14-01:30 In this category, you can change the contrast of the windows and buttons so they&#39;re easier to see. This is not the same as changing the whole screen&#39;s brightness, since not all parts of the user interface will always change. On this distribution, you see that the display is set to black and white.</p><p>If you have difficulty reading the default font, you can increase the font size with the Large Text option.</p><p>Seeing – Large Text 01:30-01:36 Seeing – Cursor Size 01:36-01:40 The Cursor Size lets you pick a cursor size that&#39;s easy to see.</p><p>Seeing - Zoom 01:40-02:00 Next, we have the Zoom option.</p><p>This option is like having a magnifying glass that lets you enlarge part of the screen.</p><p>You can choose what to magnify and how much.</p><p>For example, you can have the magnification follow the mouse or constantly magnify one part of the screen.</p><p>The additional options let you add a crosshair and change color effects.</p><p>Screen Readers and Braille 02:00-03:11 Many of the distributions also include a screen reader. The screen reader translates text on the interface into audio.</p><p>Some screen readers can use your computer&#39;s sound interface card, but others require a special speech synthesizer.</p><p>The most commonly used screen reader is probably Orca. Unlike many of the other screen readers available on Linux, Orca reads text from command windows, the GNOME desktop, and other desktops.</p><p>Other readers, such as Emacspeak, usually only work from within a terminal session or a command window.</p><p>The Orca screen reader also has the ability to interface with a refreshable braille display, allowing a seeing-impaired person to read what is displayed on their electro-mechanical device.</p><p>You can still interface with a braille device without Orca by ensuring that the &#39;brltty&#39; (braille tty) daemon is running.</p><p>The last option in the Seeing category is Sound Keys.</p><p>When this option is turned on, the user hears a beep when the Num Lock or Caps Lock key is turned on or off. Some distributions even let you choose different sound clips for alerts and allow you to set the alert volume independently of your system volume.</p><p>You can configure this setting by accessing your sound settings and then using the Sound Effects tab to change the sounds as needed.</p><p>Hearing – Visual Alerts 03:11-03:31 The next category is Hearing.</p><p>The only option in this category is Visual Alerts.</p><p>This option is closely related to the sound key option, meaning that if a person wants to be notified when an alert sound is played but can&#39;t hear the sound, a visual alert is shown. You can choose to flash the title of the window or to flash the entire screen.</p><p>Typing - Screen Keyboard 03:31-04:02 The next category is Typing.</p><p>For physically impaired users who aren&#39;t able to use a traditional keyboard, Linux provides several options for using an on-screen keyboard, which functions like the keyboard on a smartphone or tablet.</p><p>The on-screen keyboard allows users to use any pointing device, such as a mouse or touch screen, to select keys on a virtual keyboard.</p><p>Many distributions, such as this one, provide this feature as part of their accessibility settings. You can also download and install additional application like Onboard and Florence.</p><p>Repeat Keys 04:02-04:28 Next, we have Repeat Keys.</p><p>In a normal environment, if you hold down a key on your keyboard, such as the letter D, that letter is displayed or entered over and over again until you release the key.</p><p>The Repeat Keys option determines whether or not to continue typing a key that is pressed and held.</p><p>The features included with this option let you determine how long it takes before a key will start repeating and how quickly the key repeats the character.</p><p>Typing Assist – Sticky Keys 04:28-05:23 The last item we&#39;ll discuss in the Typing category is called Typing Assist.</p><p>As you see here, Typing Assist includes several options.</p><p>For example, there&#39;s Sticky Keys.</p><p>Sticky keys let you type keyboard shortcuts one key at a time rather than having to hold down all of the keys at once. For example, instead of needing to press and hold the &#39;Ctrl&#39; key and then press the ‘C&#39; key, with this feature enabled, you can instead press and release the ‘Ctrl&#39; key and then press the ‘C&#39; key.</p><p>The Sticky Keys function often includes additional options, as shown here.</p><p>Another Typing Assist option is Slow Keys.</p><p>This feature determines the delay, or the amount of time that will elapse between the time you press the key and when it is accepted. Additional features let you include sounds to aid in this process.</p><p>The last Typing Assist option is Bounce Key.</p><p>This feature is useful for people whose hands shake because it ignores it when the same key is pressed rapidly over and over.</p><p>Pointing &amp; Clicking – Mouse Keys 05:23-05:51 The last category we&#39;ll discuss is Pointing &amp; Clicking.</p><p>The first option in this category is called Mouse Keys.</p><p>This feature lets you move you mouse with the numeric keypad. For example, if you needed to move you mouse to the left, you press the number 4. To move the mouse up, press 8. And to move down, press 2.</p><p>If the computer you&#39;re using doesn&#39;t have the traditional numeric keypad, you may need to first press a function key (Fn) and then use certain other keys on your keyboard as a keypad.</p><p>Pointing &amp; Clicking - Click Assist 05:51-06:13 Click Assist has features that let you perform mouse clicks in several ways.</p><p>For example, rather than pressing a mouse button twice, you can configure your system so that when you press and then hold the mouse button down, it will automatically perform the second click for you.</p><p>You can also use this feature to perform a mouse click when you move your mouse over a button, or hover, and leave it there for a specified amount of time.</p><p>Pointing &amp; Clicking – Double-Click Delay 06:13-06:36 The last option in Pointing &amp; Clicking is the ability to adjust the double-click speed.</p><p>Double-clicking only happens when you rapidly press the mouse button twice. If the second press is too long after the first, you&#39;ll just get two separate clicks, not a double click.</p><p>By adjusting this setting, you change the amount of time that can elapse between the first click and the second click to still qualify as a double-click.</p><p>Summary 06:36-06:55 That&#39;s it for this lesson.</p><p>In this lesson, we discussed enabling and using the Universal Access options on Linux.</p><p>We talked about Seeing, Hearing, and Typing accessibilities, and then we ended this lesson by talking about the Pointing &amp; Clicking accessibilities.</p><h2 id="_5-4-2-configuring-accessibility-settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-4-2-configuring-accessibility-settings"><span>5.4.2 Configuring Accessibility Settings</span></a></h2><p>Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.</p><p>Configure Accessibility Settings 00:00-00:19 In this demonstration, we&#39;re going to look at configuring accessibility settings on Linux. Accessibility settings are designed to allow those who have some type of physical disability to use the Linux system. The steps will vary from distribution to distribution.</p><p>Universal Access Display 00:19-00:49 Using Ubuntu 22.04, we can click on the system menu and select Settings. In the navigation window on the left, we scroll down and select, Accessibility. Accessibility settings are categorized based on different types of disabilities. For example, if someone is visually impaired, we can use the Seeing settings to make things easier to see. Likewise, we can use the Hearing settings if someone has a hearing impairment. For someone with a tactile impairment, we configure Typing or Pointing &amp; Clicking settings.</p><p>Visual Impairment 00:49-01:50 Let&#39;s look at the visual impairment settings. We have the High Contrast setting. When turned on, the system will remove shading and make the display mostly black and white, making things easier to see.</p><p>Another option is Large Text. This is helpful to those that have a hard time seeing the screen. Turning this option on will cause larger text to be displayed on the screen. We also have the Zoom option. This option must be configured by specifying the magnification percentage. Let&#39;s magnify by 1.25. We then select the Magnifier Position. Let&#39;s have it Follow mouse cursor. Next, we&#39;ll turn this option on. We see that the screen is magnified, and as we move the mouse around, the magnification follows until the edges of the screen.</p><p>Another useful feature is the Screen Reader. We&#39;re told the Screen Reader reads displayed text as you move the focus. This is useful for users who have difficulty seeing the screen well enough to read the text.</p><p>Auditory Impairment 01:50-02:11 Let&#39;s move to auditory impairments. We can enable Visual Alerts. If an alert sound is played on the computer, a visual indicator will be displayed to let the user know that an alert has occurred. When enabling this feature, we can specify to flash the window or flash the entire screen. We can click test flash to see a sample.</p><p>Tactile Impairment 02:11-03:58 If we have someone with a tactile impairment, we can use the features under Typing as well as Pointing and Clicking. One of these is the Screen Keyboard. Once turned on, an onscreen keyboard will be displayed when users click on a text field. We can also enable Typing Assist. There are several different features we can enable here. For example, we can turn on Sticky Keys. When working with a Linux system, many different tasks are performed by holding down some type of modifier key and another key simultaneously, such as CTRL + C or CTRL + Z. If you have a tactile impairment, that might be difficult to do. By turning on sticky keys, users can press keys that would normally have to be pressed at the same time, one at a time. Let&#39;s use CTRL + C as an example. With sticky keys on, users can press CTRL and then press C, which would be treated as if it were a key combination being pressed simultaneously.</p><p>Other options are Slow Keys and Bounce Keys. Slow Keys puts a delay between when a key is pressed and when that key press is accepted. Bounce Keys ignores fast duplicate key presses.</p><p>We can also enable Mouse Keys. This enables key sequences to move the mouse cursor around the screen and send mouse clicks. This is designed for those who can use a keyboard but can&#39;t use a mouse.</p><p>Finally, we have the Click Assist option. There are two options we can configure. Simulated Secondary Click is designed for someone who has difficulty performing a double-click with the mouse. It allows users to just press and hold the mouse button down and send a double-click to the system for you.</p><p>With Hover Click, users move the mouse and hover over a button. Hover Click will send a click instead of pressing the mouse button.</p><p>Universal Access Menu 03:58-04:14 Let&#39;s look at the Always Show Universal Access Menu. Currently, it&#39;s turned off by default. If we turn this option on, we see the Universal Access button in the top bar. We see a summary list of most accessibility settings and can easily enable or disable them.</p><p>Summary 04:14-04:22 In this demonstration, we talked about configuring accessibility settings.</p><h2 id="_5-4-3-accessibility-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-4-3-accessibility-facts"><span>5.4.3 Accessibility Facts</span></a></h2><p>Accessibility options (also known as Universal Access or assistive technologies) allow people with tactile, audial, and visual impairments to use Linux systems by changing how the user interacts with the computer, including viewing, sound, typing, and mouse options. This lesson covers the most common options available. Know that these will vary depending on which Linux distribution and desktop you use (for example, GNOME vs. MATE).</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Configuration and menus</li><li>Seeing and Hearing options</li><li>Typing options</li><li>Pointing and Clicking options</li></ul><h3 id="configuration-and-menus" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#configuration-and-menus"><span>Configuration and Menus</span></a></h3><p>On many Linux distributions, the Universal Access features are enabled by default. However, many of the options within those features are not. To configure these options or to enable or disable Universal Access altogether, you&#39;ll need to know where to find this feature. On many distributions, you get there from the Settings page or by simply doing a search for Universal Access.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="Settings for Universal Access"></p><p>Within Universal Access, you can turn each feature on or off by selecting the accessibility icon from the drop-down menu.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="Turning on and off Universal Access features"></p><h3 id="seeing-and-hearing-options" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#seeing-and-hearing-options"><span>Seeing and Hearing Options</span></a></h3><p>The table below lists the Universal Access options found in the Seeing and Hearing categories.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Seeing</th></tr></thead><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>High Contrast</td><td> Changes the contrast of the windows and buttons so that they’re easier to see.
