Put simply, it is a security enhancement that allows users and administrators greater control over access.</p><p>Using SELinux, you can restrict access to variables, such as which users and applications can access which resources. SELinux is becoming a standard feature on many distributions, including Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora.</p><p>In this lesson, we&#39;re going to cover the basic concepts of SELinux; how to manage the program; and the modes, tools, and commands you can use with SElinux.</p><p>SELinux Operations 00:38-01:58 Keep in mind that when you use standard Linux access controls, such as granting permission using read, write, and execute (-rwxrw-r--), users and applications can both modify the controls.</p><p>On the other hand, with SELinux, access controls are determined by an SELinux policy, which can only be changed by an administrator. This prevents a careless user or misbehaving applications from making permission changes.</p><p>In addition, SELinux also adds finer granularity to access controls because SELinux access decisions are based on all available information, such as an SELinux user, role, type, and, optionally, a level.</p><p>For example, instead of only being able to specify who can read, write, or execute a file, SELinux lets you specify who can unlink, append only, move a file, and so forth. SELinux also allows you to specify access to many resources other than files, such as network resources and interprocess communication (IPC).</p><p>However, with all of these benefits, it&#39;s important to understand that SELinux is not antivirus software; it does not replace passwords, firewalls, or other security systems, nor is it an all-in-one security solution.</p><p>SELinux is designed to enhance existing security solutions, not replace them.</p><p>SELinux is installed and enabled on many Linux distributions, such as Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora.</p><p>SELinux Policies 01:58-02:46 When SELinux is enabled, policies are used to determine how and what items are protected. Policies are a set of rules that guide the SELinux security engine. For example, the SELinux policy describes the access permissions for all users, programs, processes, files, and devices they act upon.</p><p>SELinux uses one of two different policies. The first is the Targeted policy. This is the default policy. It applies access controls to certain processes. These targeted processes run in a confined domain, and processes that are not targeted run in an unconfined domain.</p><p>The second policy is Multi-Level Security, or MLS. It&#39;s not installed by default, but can be installed if needed. MLS prevents unauthorized users from accessing protected data and applications.</p><p>SELinux States and Modes 02:46-03:30 SELinux has two modes, Enforcing and Permissive. In enforcing mode, SELinux denies access based on SELinux policy rules. In other words, if something happens on the system that is against the defined policy, the action is both blocked logged. In permissive mode, the SELinux policy is not enforced. This means that SELinux does not block or deny anything from happening; however, it does log anything it would have blocked in Enforcing mode.</p><p>Permissive mode is a great tool for when you want to test a Linux system that has never used SELinux and you want to get an idea of any problems you may have or when you need to troubleshoot an issue. The nice thing about these modes is that you can switch between the two as needed without requiring a system reboot.</p><p>SELinux Status 03:30-04:06 Before we get into how to manage the different SELinux modes, let&#39;s discuss how to determine whether SELinux is installed and what mode SELinux is currently using.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to use the sestatus command. When run from a terminal, as can be seen here, sestatus provides valuable information regarding its status (enabled or disabled), the policy being used (targeted or MLS), and its current mode (enforcing or permissive).</p><p>If you only need to know which mode is being used, you can also use the getenforce command. This command will return one of three modes: Enforcing, Permissive, or Disabled.</p><p>Changing Modes 04:06-05:08 In most cases, you&#39;ll run SELinux in Enforcing mode. But if you want to see how SELinux will function on a new system or you&#39;re having issues and need to troubleshoot SELinux, you may want to switch to Permissive mode.</p><p>The setenforce command is the quickest way to temporarily switch modes. This command can only run using root permissions and supports only two options, 0 and 1.</p><p>For example, if you enter setenforce 0, SELinux will run in Permissive mode. If you run setenforce 1, SELinux will run in Enforced mode.</p><p>To change a mode permanently, you&#39;ll need to edit the /etc/selinux/config file and change the SELINUX line to the desired mode.</p><p>If, for some reason, you feel you need to turn SELinux off, you can set the SELINUX line to Disabled. Just remember that when SELinux is disabled, it&#39;s completely turned off and does not log anything.</p><p>Note that if you&#39;re disabling or enabling SELinux, you must edit the config file and then reboot your system before your changes will take effect.</p><p>SELinux Boolean 05:08-06:02 SELinux also gives you the ability to customize a policy by enabling or disabling a set of policy Booleans.</p><p>Booleans allow you to change part of the SELinux policy at run time. This lets you change portions of the policy without reloading or recompiling the SELinux policy. And you don&#39;t need very much experience with policies to handle booleans.</p><p>For example, as you work with SELinux, you may notice that some activities are denied even though there is a good reason to allow them. When this reason depends on certain factors or choices, SELinux policy writers are encouraged to make the policy optional so that it&#39;s not enabled by default.</p><p>To enforce this type of policy, you will need to use the boolean commands.</p><p>To view a list of booleans, you can use &#39;getsebool -a&#39;.</p><p>This command lists the available Booleans and shows the booleans&#39; current state.</p><p>Booleans can be one of three states: on, off, or pending.</p><p>Changing Booleans 06:02-06:45 You can change the current state of an SELinux boolean using the setsebool command. For example, if you had a boolean named zoneminder_run_sudo, you could change its state from off to on by entering setsebool zoneminder_run_sudo on.</p><p>Likewise, to turn a boolean off, you would use the off switch. You can replace on with 1 or true, and you can replace off with 0 or false. When you use this command as shown, the changed value will take effect immediately. But the next time the computer is rebooted, the default value will be used.</p><p>Therefore, if you want to make the change to the boolean permanent, you need to add the -P switch, as shown here.</p><p>SELinux Security Context 06:45-07:24 Before we end, we need to cover SELinux security contexts and how they&#39;re managed. A security context, sometimes referred to as a security label, is the method SELinux uses to classify resources, such as processes and files, on a SELinux-enabled system. This context allows SELinux to enforce rules for how and by whom a given resource should be accessed.</p><p>A security context is typically shown as a string of three or four words. Each word specifies a different component of the security context, namely the user, role, type, and level of that file or process, and each word is separated by a colon.</p><p>ls -Z 07:24-07:52 To view the SELinux context for a file, you would run &#39;ls -Z&#39; and then the name of the file, such as &#39;ls -Z /user/bin/pkexec&#39;.</p><p>With this particular example, you can see that, in addition to the normal read-write-execute permissions, the security context system_u:object_r:bin_t:s0 is shown.</p><p>ps -Z 07:52-08:16 In addition, if you want to view the security context for all of the active processes, you can use ps -eZ.</p><p>Since this will probably produce a lot of information, you can limit the results to only what you&#39;re looking for by including the grep command.</p><p>For example, if you only want to view the active processes for ibus, you can enter ps -eZ | grep ibus.</p><p>Changing Security Context - chcon 08:16-10:20 From time to time, you may find that you need to change the security context of an object. You can use the chcon command to do this. chcon stands for Change Context.</p><p>There are many ways to use this command. For example, you can change the full security context, meaning every aspect of the security context.</p><p>You can change the context using another file as a reference, or you can change just a specific portion of the context, such as the type. And if you need to make a lot of changes, you could even change the security context recursively. This is only a small list, so refer to you man pages for details about all of the available options.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at a few examples of how you can use this command.</p><p>First let&#39;s see how you can change the full SELinux context.</p><p>If I had a file named file1 in the Sales directory, I would first determine its current security context using the ls -Z command.&#39;ls -Z file1&#39; shows me the current security context for file1.</p><p>In the output, I notice that the type should be user_home instead of admin_home.</p><p>To change this, I can use the chcon command to specify the full context by typing chcon unconfied_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 file1.</p><p>And now, if re-run &#39;ls -Z file1&#39;, you see that the context has changed.</p><p>This works fine. But since the only thing I needed to change was the type, I could have just changed an individual component using the -t switch.</p><p>In a similar fashion, you can use -u to change the user field and -r to change the role field.</p><p>You can use the -R switch to make the same change to all the files in a single directory.</p><p>For example, if I have a directory named Sales, and it contains several files that all need the type component changed, I&#39;d type chcon -R -t user_home_t Sales. &quot;user_home_t&quot; is the new type component.</p><p>Restoring Security Context 10:20-10:51 The last command I want to show you is restorecon. Restorecon is most commonly used to restore SELinux security contexts back to their default values.</p><p>As with the chcon command, you can do this one file at a time, or for all the files in a directory.</p><p>For example, if I only wanted to restore the security context for one file, I would run restorecon file1.</p><p>However, if I wanted to restore the security context for all the files in a directory, I&#39;d run restorecon -R for recursive and then the folder name.</p><p>Summary 10:51-11:13 That&#39;s it for this lesson.</p><p>In this lesson, we covered the basic concepts of SELinux. Then we talked about the different modes in which SELinux functions.</p><p>We talked about profiles and explained their role in implementing SELinux.</p><p>And finally, we showed you several commands used to manage SELinux.</p><h2 id="_15-7-2-managing-selinux" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-7-2-managing-selinux"><span>15.7.2 Managing SELinux</span></a></h2><p>Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.</p><p>Manage SELinux 00:00-00:22 In this lesson, we&#39;re going to review SELinux, or Secure Linux. SELinux allows for a more granular approach to securing Linux from the outside world. This version is installed on most RHEL- or CentOS-based distributions by default. In order to properly configure SELinux, we need to elevate to the root account.</p><p>SELinux Status 00:22-00:31 Let&#39;s do the sestatus command to see if SELinux is running already. We see the current mode is enforcing. We&#39;ll go over that in a little bit.</p><p>SELinux Mode 00:31-01:06 We use the getenforce command to view the current SELinux mode. This lets us know if the system is enforcing the right properties. We can change enforcement modes with this setenforce command. Type setenforce 0 to change the mode to permissive. This will turn off the protections and controls of SELinux. When we run getenforce again, it&#39;s configured to permissive. Type setenforce 1 to change the mode back to enforcing. Now, these changes are temporary. Once we reboot, SELinux will load the configurations in the SELinux config file.</p><p>SELinux Types 01:06-01:36 Let&#39;s change directories to /etc/selinux and open the config file. We see that SELinux is enforcing, and the Linux type is targeted. This means SELinux will only monitor certain processes, and those processes will be protected. The minimum is a modification of the targeted policy. Once selected, they&#39;re protected. And MLS means multi-level security protection. We&#39;re just going to look at the targeted type in this demonstration.</p><p>getsebool 01:36-02:59 Let&#39;s exit our text editor. We&#39;re going run a program called getsebool. Getsebool is Boolean, meaning that it&#39;s either on or off. Now that&#39;s add -a for &quot;show all&quot;. We see that there are many different Boolean settings for different processes. We&#39;re going to look only at the samba processes. Let&#39;s run getsebool -a | grep samba to filter only samba processes. The process we&#39;re looking to manage here is samba_enable_home_dirs.</p><p>So, samba is the process that allows Linux to share files with Windows devices by appearing like a Windows file server. We don&#39;t want to enable home directories to be advertised on samba. Let&#39;s run setsebool samba_enable_home_dirs=off. Okay, when we rerun the filtered getsebool command, we see that samba_enable_home_dirs is now off.</p><p>Again, this is a temporary setting. If we wanted to make the changes permanent, we&#39;d type the same setsebool command but with a dash capital P for &quot;permanent&quot; and then samba_enable_home_dirs=off. Now we press Enter, and when the system reboots, samba home directories will be set to off. Let&#39;s move on.</p><p>SELinux Permissions 02:59-03:34 So, files take on different permissions with SELinux. Let&#39;s switch to the home directory and use touch file1 to create a file. Let&#39;s also see some additional SELinux components. Run ls -lZ file1. We see that the permissions are standard, with Read/write for the user and Read for the group. And then it&#39;s Read for everybody else. It&#39;s owned by root, and it&#39;s owned by a group called root as well. Now, though, we now have additional information. We have the user type, the role base, and the type of file that it is.</p><p>chcon Command 03:34-04:37 We can change this new information if we want. You might do this because you want to alter who can change the file or something like that. It gives us an additional granularity of control. To do this, you&#39;d use the change context command, called chcon. We&#39;re going to change the type from admin_home to a user_home type.</p><p>Let&#39;s type chcon -t. Now, the -t is what changes the file type, not the role or user type. Okay, continue typing user_home_t file1. We identify the file type and the file we&#39;re making the change to. Let&#39;s run ls -lZ for file1, and we see that we&#39;ve changed the type from admin_home to user_home.</p><p>Let&#39;s say that the changes ended up being a mistake. We could restore the context with a command that changes everything back. We&#39;d run restorecon, specify the file name, and it&#39;d restore the original settings. When we run ls -lZ file1 again, we see the changes.</p><p>Summary 04:37-05:00 And that&#39;s all for now. In this demonstration, we showed you some SELinux commands, including sestatus, getenforce, and setenforce. Then we modified some Boolean values with getsebool and setsebool. And we also used chcon to change and restore context.</p><h2 id="_15-7-3-selinux-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-7-3-selinux-facts"><span>15.7.3 SELinux Facts</span></a></h2><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Mandatory access control</li><li>SELinux policies</li><li>Security context</li><li>Commands</li></ul><h3 id="mandatory-access-control" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mandatory-access-control"><span>Mandatory Access Control</span></a></h3><p>Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel security module that provides a strong and flexible, mandatory access control (MAC) system for the Linux kernel. You can use SELinux to enforce access control on resources based on variables, such as users and applications. Standard Linux uses access controls, like the Read, Write, and Execute permissions, that can be modified by users and by applications. SELinux enhances security by using policies to restrict access based on variables, such as user, role, type, and level. These access controls are determined by an SELinux policy. Using this implementation, the access controls:</p><ul><li> Can only be added, deleted, or changed by an administrator.

SELinux violations are logged when an SELinux policy rule has been violated. SELinux violations are recorded as AVC (Access Vector Cache) event errors and are stored in the audit.log files (audit.log, audit.log.1, audit.log.2, etc.). These audit log files are saved in the /var/log/audit directory.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token assign-left variable">type</span><span class="token operator">=</span>ACV</span>
