You also need a basic understanding of networks and how computers communicate within a local network and over the internet. If you don&#39;t have this knowledge, you may wish to complete the TestOut PC Pro course and the TestOut Network Pro course. Additionally, 9 to 12 months experience in an IT-related job will be helpful. If you don&#39;t have this knowledge and experience, you can still take this course.

We&#39;ll begin with an overview of the Linux operating system, including its history and major distributions.</p><p>Then we&#39;ll cover some Linux basics. We&#39;ll present the Linux shell, how to get help, basic text editors, and the Linux file system. This foundational knowledge will help you understand Linux installation, localization, boot-up, and shutdown.</p><p>There are different Linux distributions and GUI desktops. We&#39;ll cover these and then turn to Linux management topics: how to install software applications, manage users, set up the file management system, and add hardware.</p><p>Next, we&#39;ll describe some topics that are internal to Linux including processes, system services, system monitoring, and networking.</p><p>We complete our course by covering Linux cloud and virtualization technologies, scripting, automation, and security.</p><h3 id="certifications-01-47-02-34" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certifications-01-47-02-34"><span>Certifications 01:47-02:34</span></a></h3><p>So, with that in mind, let&#39;s talk about the certification aspect of this course.
