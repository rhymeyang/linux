Different Linux distributions may have slight differences, so we&#39;re going to look at the generic boot process in this lesson. We&#39;ll examine the boot loader, the boot target, and the service files and daemons loaded during a boot-up. Configuring how the Linux system boots is a key skill for system administrators.</p><h3 id="linux-boot-process-00-23-00-37" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-boot-process-00-23-00-37"><span>Linux Boot Process 00:23-00:37</span></a></h3><p>To make the Linux boot process a little more digestible, we&#39;re going to break it down into the three phases that you see here. First, we&#39;re going to look at the hardware boot phase, then the bootloader phase, and we&#39;ll end with the kernel phase.</p><h3 id="linux-boot-process-–-hardware-boot-phase-00-37-01-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-boot-process-–-hardware-boot-phase-00-37-01-46"><span>Linux Boot Process – Hardware Boot Phase 00:37-01:46</span></a></h3><p>With Linux or any other OS, the first step when starting the system is the hardware boot phase. When you power on your system, it goes through a process to make sure the hardware is working properly. This is the POST, or Power On Self Test, step in running your Basic Input/Output system, or BIOS. During this phase, components such as the keyboard and mouse, CPU and RAM, I/O ports, and video are tested to make sure they&#39;re all operational. If an error occurs, your system will either beep or display an error message.</p><p>Once the POST process completes, the system boot device takes control. This device may be internal storage, an optical disk, a USB device, or an SD card. The device is usually configured in the system configuration, or it can be chosen at boot time with a key press.</p><p>Up to this point, the system&#39;s startup routine is, generally, the same as other operating systems. The process then moves to the boot device to start Linux. Traditionally, systems used BIOS to configure their systems. While there are still systems configured with legacy BIOS, UEFI or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, is more secure and provides many improvements over legacy BIOS.</p><h3 id="bootloader-phase-01-46-02-45" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bootloader-phase-01-46-02-45"><span>Bootloader Phase 01:46-02:45</span></a></h3><p>Once the system&#39;s hardware has been tested, control is given to the boot device. While the boot device may differ, it contains code that allows the system to start the operating system. This is the job of the bootloader. The bootloader loads code into RAM allowing the operating system to take over control of the hardware. This code may differ from distribution to distribution and is different than other operating systems.</p><p>After the bootloader begins loading its code, it creates a temporary virtual file system in your system RAM called a RAM disk. And, depending on your distribution, this image will either be called initrd, for initial RAM disk, or initramfs, for initial RAM file system. Both perform the same function which is to load a basic image used to load the Linux OS. This image contains just enough to get things started such as loading specific drivers for networking, video, or other specific hardware in the system. At this point, the Linux kernel is started and control of the hardware is transitioned to the kernel.</p><h3 id="kernel-phase-02-45-03-32" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kernel-phase-02-45-03-32"><span>Kernel Phase 02:45-03:32</span></a></h3><p>Once the bootloader process completes, control has been given to the kernel. The kernel is the core of the operating system. While there are many different distros available, the Linux kernel is not significantly changed. The kernel uses the RAM disk to load all the modules required to initialize the system and load necessary daemons and other programs.</p><p>At this point, the RAM disk is no longer needed so it dismounts and destroys it to reclaim the used memory. The kernel then mounts the root file system and starts probing for new hardware and loading the appropriate drivers.</p><p>Lastly, it starts the initialization process, systemd. Systemd is used to initialize the system, define the systemd target, and whether to load additional programs and daemons. At this point, the system is considered &quot;booted&quot; and you are prompted to login.</p><h3 id="summary-03-32-03-45" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-03-32-03-45"><span>Summary 03:32-03:45</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.

We looked at the hardware boot, bootloader, and kernel phases of the boot process.</p><h2 id="_4-1-2-linux-boot-process-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-1-2-linux-boot-process-facts"><span>4.1.2 Linux Boot Process Facts</span></a></h2><p>Understanding the overall boot process can be beneficial when you need to configure boot loaders, boot targets, and service files that govern the way daemons are loaded. Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is the firmware specification that was originally used by personal computers to initiate the boot process. The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) was developed to address the shortcomings of BIOS. UEFI has replaced BIOS and is now the standard used by computer manufacturers to govern the boot process.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>UEFI boot</li><li>BIOS boot</li><li>vmlinux/vmlinuz</li></ul><h3 id="uefi-boot" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#uefi-boot"><span>UEFI Boot</span></a></h3><p>UEFI (previously known as the EFI) is a firmware specification that defines the process for booting computer systems. It is the interface between a computer system&#39;s hardware/firmware and the operating system. Some of the features provided by UEFI include the following:</p><ul><li>It provides support for larger disks using the <i class="fs-italicize">Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table</i> (GPT) partition scheme. The MBR partitioning scheme used by BIOS supported only four partitions per disk, with a maximum size of 2 TB per partition. UEFI supports a maximum partition size of 9.4 ZB (9.4 x 10 <sup>21</sup> bytes).</li><li>It provides its own boot manager. This is a significant change. The old BIOS had only enough intelligence to load a single block from the storage device. This required a multi-stage boot process. UEFI has its own command interpreter and boot manager. You no longer need a dedicated boot loader as long as you place the operating system&#39;s bootable files into the EFI system partition (ESP), which is formatted with a FAT file system.</li><li>It preserves several components from the traditional BIOS, including power management and a real-time clock.</li></ul><p>The following table identifies the phases during a UEFI boot.</p>',32),e("table",null,[e("thead",null,[e("tr",null,[e("th",null,"Phase"),e("th",null,"Process")])]),e("tbody",null,[e("tr",null,[e("td",null,"UEFI"),e("td",null,[t(" The following steps take place during the UEFI boot process: "),e("ol",null,[e("li",null," Power is supplied to the processor.

These boot alternatives offer a number of benefits, including ease of administration and the ability to troubleshoot and repair a computer you cannot boot. Boot alternatives include:</p><ul><li>PXE</li><li>NFS</li><li>Boot from ISO</li><li>Boot from HTTP</li></ul><h3 id="pxe" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pxe"><span>PXE</span></a></h3><p>The Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) is the process whereby a computer initially boots from firmware installed on the computer&#39;s network card. When the client computer boots, it sends out an initial request for a PXE server. If a server that hears this request uses PXE, it sends the client a list of boot servers that contain the bootloaders available.</p><p>Using this method, a computer can download and run Linux without the need to install the operating system to its local hard drive. This method is often used on thin clients where no hard drive exists. This method can also be useful for troubleshooting a system where the bootloader has become corrupt and can no longer boot.</p><p>When using PXE, be aware of the following:</p><ul><li>The NIC in the client computer must support PXE boot.</li><li>The client BIOS/UEFI must be configured to use PXE.</li><li>The PXE client uses DHCP to obtain an IP address.</li><li>A Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server sends the necessary files to the client.

You can use the NFS file system to boot Linux on a client in a diskless/thin client environment. You can also boot Linux from the NFS file system to reduce administrative overhead. Booting from an NFS server requires a PXE environment. To boot Linux using NFS, you must specify the following for configuration:</p><ul><li>NFS client support as built-in.</li><li>The server and the name of the directory to mount as root (e.g., root=/dev/nfs).

ISO images are a convenient and common way to load a Linux distribution. An ISO image containing the Linux distribution can be used from a variety of media, including a CD/DVD, a USB stick, and a hard disk drive (HDD). The media containing the .iso image can be configured to be bootable, allowing the Linux distribution to be loaded from the media. A common system recovery tool is a bootable CD/DVD or USB drive with a Linux ISO file.</p><p>ISO files are:</p><ul><li>Uncompressed and can be in any format</li><li>A sector-by-sector copy of data</li><li>Stored inside a binary file</li><li>Identified by .iso extension</li></ul><h3 id="boot-from-http" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#boot-from-http"><span>Boot from HTTP</span></a></h3><p>HTTP is another option for booting the Linux kernel and is a function in the UEFI specifications. HTTP boot is a client-server communication-based application. It combines the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name System (DNS), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to provide the capability for system deployment and configuration over the network. Because HTTP boot provides higher performance (larger files and greater distances than TFTP), it is used to replace the PXE boot method of network deployment.</p><p>The basic process for booting using HTTP is as follows:</p><ul><li>The client initiates the DHCP process by broadcasting a DHCP request containing the HTTP Boot identifier. A DHCP server that supports the HTTP Boot extension provides a boot resource location in Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) format to the client.</li><li>The URI points to the Network Boot Program that is appropriate for the client’s request. The client then uses the HTTP protocol to download the NBP from the HTTP server to its memory.</li><li>The client executes the downloaded NBP image.
