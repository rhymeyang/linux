Most modern systems include an integrated Ethernet interface that&#39;s built into the motherboard itself. If this is the case, you&#39;re already good to go. All you have to do is plug it into the network.</p><p>Network Interface Module Installation 00:23-01:24 If your system doesn&#39;t include an integrated network interface and you have one that will work with your current hardware, the first thing you need to do is power the system off. Then you need to install an Ethernet board in an available expansion slot. Next, connect the Ethernet board to your network switch or hub with the appropriate drop cable. And finally, power the system back on.</p><p>If you installed a modern Ethernet board, then your Linux operating system should detect it as it boots up and automatically load whatever kernel modules are required. If you&#39;ve purchased and installed an off-brand Ethernet network interface or a very old Ethernet interface, you may have to go to the card vendor&#39;s website, download the appropriate module, and load it manually. But most of the time, that isn&#39;t necessary.</p><p>After the system is booted, you need to check your module configuration file and verify that the appropriate kernel module was loaded for your network interface and that an alias has been created for the new network board.</p><p>Network Interface Module Configuration 01:24-02:03 The file that you need to check depends upon which distribution you&#39;re using. Some distributions use the /etc/modprobe.conf file or the /etc/modules.conf file.</p><p>Some others use a configuration file located in the /etc/modprobe.d directory. That&#39;s the case in this example. Within my /etc/modprobe.d directory, there&#39;s a file called 50-vmnics.conf. This configuration file specifies which kernel modules need to be loaded to support this network board.</p><p>Network Device Aliases Under init 02:03-02:22 The alias that gets assigned to your network interface will also depend upon your distribution. Older distributions that are based on the init daemon will assign eth0 to the first Ethernet adapter in your system. It&#39;ll assign eth1 to the second one, eth2 to the third, and so on.</p><p>Predictable Network Interface Names 02:22-05:21 Newer distributions that are based on systemd instead of init no longer use these aliases. Systemd uses predictable network interface names. One of the benefits of doing this is that specific aliases are permanently assigned to specific network interface cards, ensuring the same adapter always gets the same alias. The aliases are defined and assigned based on several different parameters in the order shown here.</p><p>If we&#39;re dealing with an onboard network adapter that&#39;s built into the motherboard itself, then an index number is provided by the system firmware, either UEFI or the BIOS, and it&#39;s used to construct the alias.</p><p>An example is shown here. First, en indicates that it&#39;s an Ethernet interface, and the o and the 1 indicate the onboard device index number (in this case, it&#39;s just device number 1). That means the network interface integrated into the motherboard would always be assigned the alias of eno1.</p><p>If the network adapter is plugged into a PCI slot instead of being integrated into the motherboard, then systemd will use the index number of the slot itself, and this is again provided by the UEFI firmware or the BIOS on the system, and it will use this information to construct the alias.</p><p>An example of that is shown here. We have en to indicate that this is an Ethernet interface, and then s1 indicates the hot plug slot index number. This is where the network interface card has been inserted into the motherboard.</p><p>What if the first two options are not applicable? What if, for example, we&#39;ve connected a network interface into a USB connector instead of into a slot or integrating it into the motherboard? Then systemd tries to construct an alias for the network interface using the name of the physical connector that the interface is connected to.</p><p>Here&#39;s an example. We use en to indicate that it&#39;s an Ethernet interface, and then p2 identifies the bus that the interface is connected to. In this case, we&#39;re looking at USB bus 2, and the s0 indicates the slot number on the bus that the device is connected to, so it&#39;s connected to Slot 0.</p><p>There may be a situation when the first three options aren&#39;t applicable, and they fail. When this happens, systemd will try to use the interface card&#39;s MAC address to construct an alias.</p><p>As you can see here, because we&#39;re using the MAC address, the alias name gets really long. We use en to identify that it&#39;s an Ethernet interface, then an x to indicate that we&#39;re using a MAC address. And finally, we put in the MAC address that&#39;s assigned by the card.</p><p>Because this alias is a little bit funky, long, and difficult to work with, this rule is sometimes disabled by default. If none of these first four rules work, systemd will default back to the old init naming standard and just call the interface eth0.</p><p>Non-Ethernet Device Names 05:21-06:18 In the preceding examples, every single interface we looked at started with en because they&#39;re Ethernet interfaces. They&#39;re connected to an Ethernet switch, and they participate on an Ethernet network. However, this is not the only kind of interface you can install in the Linux system.</p><p>If you install a different type of interface in the system and connect it to a different type of network, a different prefix is used for the alias name.</p><p>For example, if we install a serial line interface in the Linux system and use it for, say, a WAN connection, then the name of that serial line interface is going to begin with sl instead of en to indicate that it&#39;s a serial interface, not an Ethernet interface.</p><p>Likewise, a lot of Linux systems use wireless interfaces. If you install a wireless network interface in the system, the alias for those interfaces will begin with wl instead of en.</p><p>Summary 06:18-06:42 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this video, we reviewed how Linux creates aliases for network interfaces. First, we reviewed how the older init daemon created network device aliases. Then we reviewed how systemd uses predictable network interface names to create network device aliases.</p><h2 id="_12-2-2-address-configuration-part-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_12-2-2-address-configuration-part-1"><span>12.2.2 Address Configuration Part 1</span></a></h2><p>Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.</p><p>Address Configuration 00:00-00:27 After installing a network interface in your Linux system, you need to configure four different parameters on that interface for that system to participate on an IP-based computer network. Those parameters are IP address, subnet mask, defining the default gateway router address, and assigning the DNS server address.</p><p>In this lesson, we&#39;ll focus on the first two parameters—assigning the IP address and the subnet mask.</p><p>Address Assignment Options 00:27-02:03 There are two ways to accomplish this. The first is a static IP address assignment, and the second is a dynamic IP address assignment.</p><p>In a static IP address assignment, you manually configure the network host with an IP address and subnet mask. If you do this, the IP address stays static. It never changes. This is the preferred option for working with a network server because you don&#39;t want server IP addresses changing.</p><p>However, we typically don&#39;t use static IP address assignment for workstations. This is because if you use a static IP address assignment, that host will consume that IP address, whether the system is in use or not. It also requires a lot of legwork from the system administrator because you must visit every single computer and manually specify the IP networking parameters.</p><p>The opposite is true for dynamic IP address assignment. With this one, the computer goes out on the network and contacts a dynamic host configuration protocol server, or DHCP Server, when that system first boots up. The DHCP server automatically assigns whatever IP address is currently available to that host for a specific amount of time. That&#39;s called lease time.</p><p>This option makes it easy to configure IP networking parameters on a very large number of network hosts without having to do much. Just turn the workstation on, and it gets its IP addressing information. It also conserves IP address usage because addresses being used by systems that are powered off can be reassigned to another network host that currently needs it.</p><p>The reason this won&#39;t typically be used for servers is because the address that gets assigned to a particular host can change frequently. This isn&#39;t a good thing for infrastructure systems like servers. They need the same IP address all the time.</p><p>Viewing Addressing Information with ifconfig 02:03-03:56 Now let&#39;s talk about configuring an IP address statically on a system such as a server. One way to do this is to use the ifconfig command at the shell prompt. If you type ifconfig without any options, all it does is display the current status of all the network interfaces in the system. Notice in the output that I have two network interfaces listed, ens32 and lo. ens32 is the Ethernet interface installed on my system that&#39;s connected to my network switch.</p><p>On the other hand, the lo interface isn&#39;t a real network interface. There&#39;s no physical interface in the system assigned the alias of lo because lo is a virtual network interface. It&#39;s the local loopback adapter. It&#39;s assigned a special IP address of 127.0.0.1. It&#39;s only used for internal communications between network services running on the system. It won&#39;t communicate on the network. This is required for most</p><p>Linux services to run properly, so don&#39;t do anything foolish like deleting it. You also don&#39;t need to worry about its configuration. Focus up here on the one that&#39;s connected to the physical network.</p><p>Notice in the output of ifconfig that several important network parameters are listed. First, we have the HWaddr parameter, which is the MAC address assigned to the network board. We have the inetaddr, which is the IP address assigned to the network interface. We also have the Bcast parameter, which specifies the broadcast address of the network segment. We have the Mask parameter, which specifies the subnet mask assigned to the interface.</p><p>Down here, we have RX packets, which specify statistics for the received packets on the interface. We also have TX packets, which contain statistics for transmitted packets from the interface. Collisions down here track the number of collisions detected by the interface, which on a modern Ethernet network should be zero—it is. We also have RX bytes, which tell us how many bytes have been received by the interface, and TX bytes, which tells us how many bytes have been transmitted by the interface.</p><p>Summary 03:56-04:13 Well, that&#39;s it for now. In this lesson, I gave you an overview of address configuration options and ifconfig. In another lesson, we&#39;ll learn how to use it to make a static IP address assignment and a dynamic IP address assignment.</p><h2 id="_12-2-3-address-configuration-part-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_12-2-3-address-configuration-part-2"><span>12.2.3 Address Configuration Part 2</span></a></h2><p>Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.</p><p>Address Configuration 00:00-00:17 In a previous lesson, we discussed network interface parameters. We also discussed IP address assignment options and had an overview of the ifconfig command. With these basics in mind, let&#39;s discuss assigning the IP address and the subnet mask.</p><p>Configuring an Address with ifconfig 00:17-01:01 As previously discussed, you can use ifconfig to display information about a network interface. You can also use it to assign IP networking parameters.</p><p>The syntax for doing this is shown here. Type &#39;ifconfig&#39;, followed by the interface you want to make the assignment to, then the IP address that you want to assign, then &#39;netmask,&#39; followed by the subnet mask you want to assign, then &#39;broadcast,&#39; followed by the broadcast address of the network segment.</p><p>Here&#39;s an example. We&#39;re assigning the ens32 interface an IP address of 192.168.1.1, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and a broadcast address of 192.168.1.255.</p><p>Interface Configuration File 01:01-03:17 If you make a static IP address assignment with the ifconfig command, that assignment is not persistent. If you remove the system, it&#39;ll be lost. To make it persistent, configure a special file in the /etc/sysconfig/network directory.</p><p>In this example, the file we&#39;ll use to configure a static IP address on an Ethernet interface is named ifcfg-ens32. This is the way it works on the openSUSE distribution. On other distributions, this file might be named differently. For example, it might be named using the MAC address of the NIC. You&#39;ll have to check how your distribution names the interface configuration file.</p><p>This file&#39;s used to configure IP addressing parameters on that interface when the system turns on. The first parameter you should know in this file is BOOTPROTO. Right now, it&#39;s set to &#39;dhcp,&#39; which specifies that we dynamically assigned this interface and IP address from a DHCP server. You could change this to a value of &#39;static,&#39; which would specify that the interface uses a static IP address assignment.</p><p>We also have a parameter down here called STARTMODE, and it&#39;s currently set to &#39;auto.&#39; This option specifies that the interface will automatically be brought online when the system is booted. If you set it to a value of &#39;manual,&#39; then you&#39;d have to manually start the interface.</p><p>If we&#39;ve specified BOOTPROTO=&#39;dhcp,&#39; we don&#39;t have to do much else with this configuration file because that&#39;ll be taken care of by the DHCP Server. On the other hand, if we specified a static IP address assignment, we&#39;d have to go through the rest of these options and configure the appropriate parameters.</p><p>For example, IPADDR. We&#39;d have to specify the IP address we want to assign to this interface and the subnet mask under the NETMASK parameter. We&#39;d also have to specify the network address of the network segment. We&#39;d have to specify the broadcast address of the network segment as well.</p><p>There are some additional parameters you can modify if you need to, such as the MTU, where you can set the size of the maximum transmission unit. This is always set to 1500 by default on Ethernet networks. There are situations when you might need to change this. For example, if your network uses jumbo frames, you could set this parameter to something like 9000 instead of 1500. This isn&#39;t done very often, however.</p><p>Restarting a Network Interface 03:17-03:46 If you make any changes to this file, you must restart the network interface to apply the change. Otherwise, it won&#39;t be applied until the next time you boot the system. One simple way to do this is to use the ifdown command to take the interface down and then bring it back up with the ifup command.</p><p>An example&#39;s shown here. We enter &#39;ifdown ens32,&#39; followed by &#39;ifup ens32.&#39; At this point, the new configuration parameters we specified will be applied to that interface.</p><p>Getting an Address Dynamically 03:46-04:45 If you want your network interface to get an IP address from a DHCP server, you can do that from the command prompt, using the &#39;dhclient&#39; command. If you&#39;ve configured DHCP in your interface configuration file, you can accomplish the same thing using the ifdown and ifup commands. Because of your configuration in the interface configuration file, it will talk to DHCP.</p><p>If you want to tell a running interface to get an address from a DHCP Server, regardless of whether it&#39;s set to use a static address or dynamic address, you can run the dhclient command shown here. The syntax is to enter &#39;dhclient,&#39; then the name of the interface that needs to contact a DHCP Server and get an IP address—in this case, &#39;ens32.&#39; Notice when we do that, the interface first sends out a DHCPREQUEST packet and then it gets a DHCPACK back from the DHCP sever. The IP address of 10.0.0.97 was sent back from the DHCP server to the ens32 interface to be its IP address.</p><p>Viewing Address Information with ip 04:45-05:13 Another command you can use to manage IP addressing on a Linux system is the ip command. In this example, I&#39;m using the ip command to view my current networking configuration. I type &#39;ip addr show,&#39; and it shows me my configuration for my loopback interface and my ens32 interface. I can see many of the same statistics I saw with the ifconfig command, such as my MTU Size, my IP address and Mask, my Broadcast address, and so on.</p><p>Managing IP Addressing with ip 05:13-05:51 You can also use the ip command to configure IP addressing parameters. To do that, you use the syntax shown here. Enter &#39;ip addr add,&#39; the IP address that we want to assign to the interface, �dev,&#39; then the name of the interface.</p><p>If we want to remove an IP address, we replace add with �del,&#39; which will remove the IP address from the specified interface. If we want to disable an interface, meaning take it down, we enter &#39;ip link set interface down.&#39; To re-enable that interface, we do &#39;ip link set interface up.&#39; That&#39;s the equivalent of using the ifdown and ifup commands.</p><p>Summary 05:51-06:20 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we talked about how to configure an Ethernet network interface in a Linux system. We talked about how to use ifconfig to make a static IP address assignment. We also talked about accomplishing the same thing using an interface configuration file. Then we looked at using dynamic addressing on an Ethernet interface and finally ended by reviewing how to use the ip command to manage IP addressing on a network interface.</p><h2 id="_12-2-4-view-and-manage-ipv4-addresses" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_12-2-4-view-and-manage-ipv4-addresses"><span>12.2.4 View and Manage IPv4 Addresses</span></a></h2><p>Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.</p><p>View and Manage IPv4 Addresses 00:00-00:18 We&#39;re going to discuss different ways you can view and manage the network interface parameters from the shell prompt. We&#39;re going to focus on two different command-line tools in this demo: ifconfig and ip.</p><p>Use ifconfig 00:18-01:23 It&#39;s important to understand that the ifconfig command has been depreciated. Meaning it&#39;s being phased out and, in some cases, no longer available by default. However, if you find that the distribution you&#39;re working on doesn&#39;t have ifconfig, you can typically still get it by installing net-tools.</p><p>Ifconfig is short for interface config and can be run by any standard user to view the current networking configuration. As seen here, running ifconfig shows that this system has two interfaces: one named lo and the other named eth0. This may be confusing at first. If you only have one network card installed on the system, why would two interfaces show?</p><p>Every Linux system has a virtual interface. This is the lo, or loopback interface shown. It&#39;s mainly used by local services running on the system to send messages back and forth and can also be used for diagnostics and troubleshooting.</p><p>The other interface shown, eth0 is the Ethernet adapter installed on this system.</p><p>View Interface Statistics 01:23-02:14 The ifconfig output provides a lot of information regarding this interface. We can see that an IPv4 address of 192.168.78.10 has been assigned to this network card, with a netmask or subnet mask of 255.255.240.0 and a broadcast address of 192.168.79.255. If your system has Ipv6 enabled, you&#39;ll also see Ipv6 information.</p><p>This line shows the hardware or MAC address and lets us know that this is an Ethernet adapter. The last few lines show statistics about the IP packets that have been received and transmitted. RX indicates the packets that have been received, while TX gives us information about the packets that have been transmitted.</p><p>Configure IP Address Parameters 02:14-03:28 Modifying IP addresses can only be done using root privileges. To configure Ipv4 information manually, we use the ifconfig command and specify the parameters required.</p><p>The first parameter is the name of the network card you want to modify. It&#39;s possible to have several network interfaces installed on your system. Make sure you identify the network card you wish to make edits to. For this system, we type eth0.</p><p>Next, enter the new IP address 192.168.78.20. If that&#39;s the only change, we could press Enter now. However, to change the subnet mask, we&#39;d type netmask, followed by the desired mask. We&#39;ll keep the same netmask and type 255.255.240.0.</p><p>Type broadcast for the broadcast address for this network segment. We&#39;ll also keep the same broadcast of 192.168.79.255. Press Enter. The order of the parameters used with ifconfig isn&#39;t critical, as long as you first specify which network card you&#39;re modifying. When we run ifconfig again, we see that the IP address was changed to .20.</p><p>Use if Commands 03:28-04:23 We can turn the interface off and on with ifdown and ifup. The ifdown command disables the network interface. When we type ifdown eth0 and press Enter, the network interface is brought down. When we run ifconfig, the only adapter shown is the loopback. To enable or start the adapter, type ifup eth0 and press Enter.</p><p>The Ethernet interface is now visible, but the IP address was changed back to its original address of .10. When a network adapter is initialized, the system looks at a configuration file. This file tells the system how to get its IP address information. If the system is configured for DHCP, it will have an IP address automatically assigned. This means that changing the IP address using ifconfig is a temporary change.</p><p>ip vs ifconfig 04:23-04:38 Let&#39;s shift gears and look at the preferred way to view and manage your network interface parameters with the IP tool. We&#39;ll see how to use ip to view and perform basic networking management, as we just did with ifconfig.</p><p>Use ip Command 04:38-05:13 Any standard user can use the ip command to view the current networking configuration. The ip command makes use of an option called an object. The man pages for the ip command show that this tool can be used for more than just IP addresses.</p><p>We see that an object is such things as a link and an address. Further down, we see a summary of the options, such as -h for human readable. A command is an action performed on the object, such as adding, deleting, or showing the object.</p><p>This was a brief overview of the ip command options.</p><p>View Network Configuration 05:13-05:45 We can&#39;t run ip by itself to view the networking configuration. We need to type ip and then the object, which is the address, and then the command to show this object or address.</p><p>We see much of the same information we saw when using ifconfig. Instead of showing the netmask in dotted decimal format, it&#39;s shown using the CIDR notation of /20. Instead of using the full ip [CC1]address show command, we can use ip a, which will show me the same information.</p><p>Add IP Addresses 05:45-06:30 We can use the ip command to temporarily change the IP information assigned to an interface. With ip, we want to add the correct IP information and then delete the incorrect information.</p><p>To add an IP address to your interface, type ip address add, followed by the new IP address. We&#39;ll use 192.168.78.15 followed by the subnet mask using the CIDR notation of /20. Next, we need to tell ip which interface to use, so we type dev for device and then the name of our device, which is eth0. When we run ip a again, we see two IP addresses assigned to the eth0 interface.</p><p>Delete IP Addresses 06:30-06:42 I can delete or remove the old IP address by typing ip address del 192.168.78.10. When we run ip a, we see the .10 address was deleted.</p><p>Change the ip Address State 06:42-07:27 With the ip command, changing the interface&#39;s status with the ip object named link will enable or disable the interface. To disable our eth0 interface, type ip link set, followed by the name of the interface, which is eth0, and then down.</p><p>This is a big difference between ifdown and ip&#39;s equivalent of ip link set down. When I run ip a again, we still see the eth0 interface. However, if you look closely, you&#39;ll see that the state of this interface is listed as being down, meaning that it&#39;s not listening or responding to network requests.</p><p>To bring this interface back online, we use the same command but change it from &#39;down&#39; to &#39;up.&#39;</p><p>Summary 07:27-07:38 In this demonstration, we looked at commands you can use from the shell prompt to manage IP addresses on your system.</p><h2 id="_12-2-5-addressing-method-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_12-2-5-addressing-method-facts"><span>12.2.5 Addressing Method Facts</span></a></h2><p>There are two options for assigning IP addresses.
