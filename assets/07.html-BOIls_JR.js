Unless configured otherwise, bash commands use the following standard streams:</p><ul><li>Standard input (stdin) is data that is typically streamed from the keyboard. If a bash command accepts input, by default, it is gathered from stdin.</li><li>Standard output (stdout) is data that is typically streamed to the console screen. By default, bash commands send their output to stdout.</li><li>Standard error (stderr) is data that is also typically streamed to the console screen. If a command needs to output an error messages or give diagnostics, by default, it sends this output to stderr.</li></ul><p>The bash shell assigns a file descriptor to each of the standard streams. A file descriptor is a handle or number that identifies an open file or other data source and how that resource can be accessed. The following table summarizes these ideas.</p><table><thead><tr><td>Standard Stream</td><td>File Descriptor</td><td>Associated Device</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>stdin</td><td>0</td><td>Keyboard</td></tr><tr><td>stdout</td><td>1</td><td>Console screen or graphical shell window</td></tr><tr><td>stderr</td><td>2</td><td>Console screen or graphical shell window</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="redirection" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#redirection"><span>Redirection</span></a></h3><p>Linux commands can be modified to divert the standard input, output, and error streams to locations other than the default.
