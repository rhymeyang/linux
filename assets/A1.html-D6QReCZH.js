As you work through the course, follow these hints for effective study: <ul><li> Review the learning and exam objectives on each section page. The objectives outline the knowledge and skills you&#39;ll need for the official certification exam. </li><li>Watch the videos.</li><li>Watch the demonstrations.</li><li>Read all text lesson fact pages.</li><li> Practice the tasks in the lab simulations until you feel comfortable with your ability to complete them. </li><li> Avoid skipping any sections unless you can easily pass the Practice Questions at the end of each section. Even if you already know the material, a review can always be helpful when preparing for an exam. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Review the Certification Exam domains and objectives</td><td> Review the domains and objectives for the TestOut Linux Pro Certification provided in this section. </td></tr><tr><td>Take the Domain Practice Exams</td><td> The Domain Practice Exams group the performance-based labs by domain and help assess your understanding of a particular TestOut Linux Pro Certification domain and the corresponding objectives. </td></tr><tr><td>Take the Certification Practice Exam</td><td> After you&#39;re confident with your ability to complete the labs, take the Certification Practice Exam to assess your preparedness to take the actual Certification Exam. <ul><li> This exam has roughly the same number of questions and time limit as the TestOut Linux Pro Certification Exam. </li><li> Practice questions are designed to assess your knowledge as it relates to the exam objectives. </li><li> Based on your Practice Exam results, review the course material for questions that you missed. </li><li> Focus your time on understanding the topics covered in the objectives and not on memorizing answers, as the actual Certification Exam will have a different set of questions. </li><li> When your Practice Exam scores are consistently over 95%, and you feel confident in your understanding of the exam objectives and topics, the next step is to take the actual Certification Exam. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Schedule and take the Certification Exam</td><td> The TestOut Linux Pro Certification Exam is scheduled through LabSim.
