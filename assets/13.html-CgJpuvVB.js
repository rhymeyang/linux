Using sed, you can capture a text stream and then modify it. You can search through the text stream for certain words to replace with different words or delete them.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at an example. In the home directory, I have a file named customers. This file contains a customer&#39;s first name, last name, and phone number. Recently, due to the growth of a state, a new area code was added. This affects all my customers with an area code of 801. To fix that, I can use sed to find all occurrences of 801 and replace it with the new area code of 435. Looking at my file, we see that this change needs to be made for Mike Lewis and Vera Olsen.</p><p>This is done by typing <code>sed -i</code>. The <code>-i</code> tells sed to edit the file in place instead of writing its output to the screen. Next, we add s, which stands for substitute. If we wanted to delete text, we&#39;d use d. To separate the substitute option from what we want to substitute, we next add a forward slash (/) as a delimiter character.</p><p>With the s option, we then specify what text it is that we want to locate. For this example, we wanted to substitute the area code of 801 with the new area code of 435. We use a forward slash to separate what will be found and the new text.</p><p>Next, I need to use a forward slash as another delimiter and then g, to tells sed to do a global search, meaning to search through everything. To end the command, I need to specify the text source, which is my file named customers, and I&#39;ll press Enter.</p><p>By running cat on our customers file, we see that both instances of 801 were changed to 435.</p><h3 id="awk-command-01-52-05-00" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#awk-command-01-52-05-00"><span><code>awk</code> Command 01:52-05:00</span></a></h3><p>The next utility we&#39;re going to look at is the awk command. awk is an enhanced and more powerful version of sed, used to perform more complex stream editing. awk treats a file as if it were a database and each line is a record. For example, looking at our customers file again, we see it contains record 1, record 2, and so forth.</p><p>Within a database, a record is made up of individual fields. awk defines fields based on spaces. The space between each word creates a new field. The important thing to remember when working with awk is that each of these fields is referenced with a different number. Field 1 is $1, field 2 is $2, field 3 is $3, and so forth.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at a simple example of using awk. I want to use awk to find and display all the last names of my customers. Notice that the last names are the second item listed in each line, or for awk, they are the second field in each line. To do this, let&#39;s enter cat customers to create our text stream. But then we&#39;ll pipe out the results of cat, to the awk command. To show the last names, we&#39;ll tell awk to use the print command to print the second field. Enter a tick, open curly bracket, the word print, and then dollar sign 2. A closed curly bracket, ended with a tick (&#39;{print $2}&#39;). When I press Enter, you see that only the second field, the field containing the last names, was printed to the screen.</p><p>awk can also add characters to the text stream and reformat the output in a wide variety of ways. To allow us to add text before each field in a record, let&#39;s modify our last command. But before pressing Enter, let&#39;s explain what this command is doing.</p><p>The first thing we want awk to do is to print the word First and a colon, so we know what follows is the first name. Then, we want awk to print the first field from our customers file. This is done using $1, but must be in its own set of quote marks, to set it apart from the literal text we are adding. To make our output look a little neater, we want to add a tab. This will make sure that the next fields will all line up. This is done using the \\t. Then, to end this part of the output, we close with quote marks.</p><p>We now want to do the same for the other two fields. We added quote, Last:, followed by the second field, which is $2. Another tab, and we ended this second section with a quote mark. And we finished this command by adding the word Phone: and then a $3 to print the third field, or the phone number.</p><p>When I press Enter, we see that for each record, awk first printed the text, First:, then grabbed field number 1, in this case, Mike. Then it printed a tab, and then it added Last:, and then whatever the value field 2 is, in this case Lewis. And then a tab and then Phone:, then the value of field 3 for each record.</p><p>This is a simple example of how you can use awk to manipulate the text in a text stream.</p><h3 id="tr-command-05-00-05-44" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tr-command-05-00-05-44"><span><code>tr</code> Command 05:00-05:44</span></a></h3><p>The last command we want to look at is the <code>tr</code> command. You can use this command to translate or delete characters. You could cause all lowercase characters in the text stream to be translated into uppercase characters.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at an example of doing this. Let&#39;s use the &#39;cat&#39; command. We want to send the output of the <code>cat</code> command – viewing the customers file – to the input of the tr command. This is done by adding the pipe character (<code>|</code>) and the command <code>tr</code>. Let&#39;s tell it to translate all the lowercase characters a-z to upper case characters A-Z. When I press Enter, we see all the lowercase characters in each name were translated from lowercase to uppercase characters.</p><h3 id="summary-05-44-06-00" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-05-44-06-00"><span>Summary 05:44-06:00</span></a></h3><p>In this demonstration, we reviewed processing text streams.
