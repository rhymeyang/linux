Locale information includes language, timezone, text encoding, time, date, and currency formats. While they don&#39;t entirely affect the inner workings or the performance of Linux, they do have much to do with displaying text on the screen. In older Linux versions, many of these settings were configured using locale environmental variables. Now they are preconfigured, and only the language used, and its encoding are configured with a variable.</p><h3 id="locale-details-00-38-01-23" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#locale-details-00-38-01-23"><span>Locale Details 00:38-01:23</span></a></h3><p>During installation, you&#39;re prompted to answer your language preference. When making the language choice, you&#39;re also configuring additional locale information. When selecting a region such as the United States or Canada, the number, currency, and measurement settings are configured. When selecting the time format, you&#39;re configuring the date and time formats. This is important since there may be more than one language for a given country, and the individual settings for that country may change. Also, most Linux distros have a method to install remote languages and their settings. This helps to make Linux an operating system that the world can use and customize to their region.</p><h3 id="example-linux-mint-01-23-01-48" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-linux-mint-01-23-01-48"><span>Example: Linux Mint 01:23-01:48</span></a></h3><p>Here&#39;s an example of how to set locale settings. Here, in Linux Mint, you can set the Language, Region, Time format, System locale, and Install/Remove Languages in a single point-and-click menu. By clicking and choosing the language and region, all of the other settings for date, time, numbers, etc., are configured.</p><h3 id="example-red-hat-01-48-02-25" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-red-hat-01-48-02-25"><span>Example: Red Hat 01:48-02:25</span></a></h3><p>As you can see here, in Red Hat, the look and feel are much different. Here you have a menu of several system settings to choose from. For Region and Language, there are only two configurable items, Language and Formats. Again, you can choose from several languages and formats to change the locale information.</p><p>The primary takeaway is that most Linux distributions have methods to affect how information is displayed on the screen. You can choose from different languages and different display formats. The look and feel may be slightly different, but it&#39;s not overly complex.</p><h3 id="viewing-locale-information-02-25-04-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#viewing-locale-information-02-25-04-18"><span>Viewing Locale Information 02:25-04:18</span></a></h3><p>When your system was initially installed, the locale information was also configured. To view a list of locale variables, you can issue the locale command to view the variables. Here, using a Red Hat Linux server, you can see the LC variables and their settings. Here you see, they&#39;re all the same since everything is configured for English US. The encoding here is UTF-8. All of the US default locale settings are used. In some systems, however, there may be other configurations where most of these values are blank and instead use LC_ALL or the LANG variables.</p><p>Locale information is configured differently in different distributions. While not common, you may have to change locale information for a given system. For example, if the system was set up in Canada where English is spoken but gets moved to French Canada, the language must be changed. Or, if a system is created in the UK but gets shipped to Mexico, the language and locale settings must be changed. Using the graphical tools, this is generally not a problem. However, there are text-based tools to help with that, and they differ from distribution to distribution.</p><p>Another situation might involve multiple users. Suppose there&#39;s a Linux system used by users who require different locale information. One might use the system for entering orders in the US. Another might use the same system to fulfill orders out of Brazil. Each user is using different locale information based on their Linux profile on the same machine. So, while most systems are stationary and use a single locale configuration for the life of the machine, there are situations where changes are needed.</p><h3 id="convert-encoding-04-18-05-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#convert-encoding-04-18-05-15"><span>Convert Encoding 04:18-05:15</span></a></h3><p>As Linux grows in popularity, it&#39;s used in more countries with more languages and regions. While most use UTF-8 encoding, some systems may not. Additionally, data may come from other types of systems, including PCs, mainframes, and others. The data you receive may be encoded differently than your system, rendering the data unreadable. The utility program called &#39;iconv&#39; can be used to convert from one format to another. Here, there are a few parameters that can be used. For example, you can use iconv to convert data from infile.dat using encoding utf-8 to outfile.dat using encoding ebcdic-us. Check your distro to find out whether or not it supports the iconv program.</p><h3 id="summary-05-15-05-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-05-15-05-38"><span>Summary 05:15-05:38</span></a></h3><p>For this lesson you learned about locale information and how it affects displaying information on your screen. You learned that the locale and region settings affect text, numbers, data and time formats. You also learned about the locale command and iconv program.</p><h2 id="_3-3-2-configuring-locale-settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-3-2-configuring-locale-settings"><span>3.3.2 Configuring Locale Settings</span></a></h2><h3 id="configure-locale-settings-00-00-00-37" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#configure-locale-settings-00-00-00-37"><span>Configure Locale Settings 00:00-00:37</span></a></h3><p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to configure locale settings. Locale settings are used to localize the shell and sometimes GUI environments. In other words, we make the time, date, currency formats, and language all match the location where we live or work.</p><p>For example, in the United States, the monetary system is based on dollars and is represented by a dollar sign ($). But if you live in England, your monetary system is based on the pound and is represented by a pound sign (£). Likewise, if you live in Canada, you might speak French and would probably find it more convenient to view the man pages in your native language.</p><h3 id="use-the-locale-command-to-view-variables-00-37-00-57" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-the-locale-command-to-view-variables-00-37-00-57"><span>Use the locale Command to View Variables 00:37-00:57</span></a></h3><p>Now, locale settings are controlled by environment variables. To view these variables, all you have to do is type locale at the shell prompt. You can see that a list of the various locale environment variables pops up along with their values. LC_TIME is what determines if the time will be shown in a 24-hour or 12-hour format.</p><h3 id="variable-syntax-00-57-03-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#variable-syntax-00-57-03-11"><span>Variable Syntax 00:57-03:11</span></a></h3><p>Each locale environment variable consists of two parts—the variable name followed by the assigned value. Let&#39;s see how this system&#39;s time is currently configured. When we type date, we see that the date and time are shown in typical US English format. To temporarily change the format to what a French Canadian might see, we begin by typing the name of the variable, LC_TIME, followed by an equal sign.</p><p>Everything after the equal sign is the value assigned to that variable. When assigning a value to a variable, first specify the language you want that variable to use. You do this with a language code, such as en for English. To change the language to French, type lowercase fr. It has to be in lowercase because it&#39;s based on a standard known as ISO 639.</p><p>Next is the country code. This is separated from the language code with an underscore. US would be for the United States and CA for Canada. The country code has to be in uppercase because it&#39;s based on another standard called ISO 3166.</p><p>Next, add a period followed by the character set. There are several sets available, but UTF-8 is the typical one. And there are also additional options available by putting an @ sign after the character set and including a modifier. The modifier specifies more locale attributes, like a particular dialect or a different currency. The modifier is frequently used in Europe to differentiate between countries that use the euro and those that don&#39;t, but still speak the same language.</p><p>The L A N G or LANG variable, however, will apply the language settings to all other variables. Once the language is set everywhere, we can change individual variables as needed.</p><p>Let&#39;s change the LANG variable to German here. We type LANG and use the language code of de, the country code of DE, and the UTF-8 character set. Now we export the variable and view the changes. The German settings have been applied to all the variables.</p><p>We can see which variables were inherited from LANG, as they have quotation marks surrounding them. When we enter invalid commands, the error message shows up in German.</p><h3 id="make-permanent-locale-changes-03-11-04-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#make-permanent-locale-changes-03-11-04-19"><span>Make Permanent Locale Changes 03:11-04:19</span></a></h3><p>This method only changes the variables temporarily. We use the localectl tool to make changes permanent. Let&#39;s see the current settings by typing localectl status. You&#39;ll notice that the German language changes were in fact temporary and don&#39;t appear here. When we reboot the system, it&#39;ll revert to the settings we&#39;re looking at now. We can see which language and country codes are available with the localectl list-locales command. Let&#39;s reboot the machine to restore the US English default.</p><p>Once it&#39;s rebooted, we see that the locale settings have reverted back. The default settings are saved in the /etc/default/locale file and can be seen using the cat command. Run cat /etc/default/locale. To make a permanent change, type localectl set-locale and the desired locale setting. Let&#39;s use the LANG variable again to change all the variables at once. Type LANG=fr_CA.UTF-8.</p><h3 id="summary-04-19-04-40" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-19-04-40"><span>Summary 04:19-04:40</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this demonstration.
