The remote computer runs the server version of the system, and the local computer runs the client version. The two computers use SSH tunneling to create a secure connection. Once the connection is made, the client user can operate the server computer as though they were in the same room.</p><p>Uses 00:28-00:50 Remote desktop is useful for many things. In enterprise situations, administrators can access servers directly without having to walk all the way to the networking closet. Helpdesk staff can troubleshoot and fix computer problems from their own workspace instead of having to oust their coworkers from their desk. Travelers can pack a lightweight laptop, but still have access to their powerful desktop resources as though they&#39;d never left.</p><p>Features 00:50-01:05 Most remote desktop applications provide several important features. In addition to accessing remote computers, they can send print jobs to local printers, listen to audio from the remote system, and copy and paste data between the local and remote systems.</p><p>Considerations 01:05-01:44 There are several considerations to keep in mind when using remote desktop. While the remote session is active, the desktop on the target computer is locked. Interactive logons are blocked for the duration of the remote session. While the session is active, nobody else can log in without disconnecting the remote session first. Conversely, if another user is already logged on to the remote system, you can&#39;t establish a remote desktop connection without first logging out the existing authenticated user.</p><p>The quality of the remote desktop experience is heavily dependent on your network connection. For the best experience, the server needs a fast upload speed, and the client needs a fast download speed.</p><p>Finally, let&#39;s look at a few remote desktop systems and protocols for Linux.</p><p>Remote Desktop Technologies 01:44-02:08 The most common is VNC, which stands for Virtual Network Computing. Another one you&#39;ll run into is xrdp, which is an open-source implementation of Microsoft&#39;s Remote Desktop Protocol. NX is owned by NoMachine, a company in Luxembourg. SPICE, or Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments, is owned by Red Hat.</p><p>Summary 02:08-02:22 In this lesson, we talked about remote desktop connections.

None is strictly better or worse than the others, so the remote desktop system you use will often be determined by your unique circumstances and personal preference.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Technology</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Virtual Network Computing <br> (VNC) </td><td> VNC allows you to connect to and control a remote computer. In doing so, VNC transmits the keyboard and mouse events from the remote server back to the client computer. VNC also supports relaying graphical user interface (GUI) updates back to the client computer over the network. VNC is one of the most popular remote desktop technologies. </td></tr><tr><td>xrdp</td><td> xrdp is an open-source implementation of Microsoft&#39;s Remote Desktop Protocol. This technology allows a Windows machine to connect to a Linux system using Windows Remote Desktop. xrdp also works with FreeRDP and rdesktop. This technology uses Xvnc or X11rdp to manage the X session. </td></tr><tr><td>NX</td><td> NX is the remote desktop protocol developed by a company called NoMachine. They produce a remote desktop solution (also named NoMachine) that lets you connect using the NX or SSH protocols (NX is used by default). In addition to Linux, NX is also available on the other common platforms, such as Windows, Mac and iOS, Android, and Raspberry. This allows you to connect to and from various platforms, such as from Linux to Linux or to and from Linux and Windows. </td></tr><tr><td> Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments <br> (SPICE) </td><td> The main purpose of SPICE is to provide a complete, open-source solution for remote access to virtual machines. With SPICE, you can seamlessly play videos, record audio, share USB devices, and share folders without complications. The basic building blocks for SPICE are the SPICE protocol, server, and client. SPICE-related components include QXL (a paravirtualized framebuffer device) and the guest QXL driver. Qumranet originally developed SPICE using a closed-source codebase in 2007. However, in 2008, Red Hat, Inc. acquired Qumranet. Then in December of 2009, Red Hat released the code under an open-source license and made the protocol an open standard. </td></tr></tbody></table>',30)]))}const d=t(n,[["render",a],["__file","03.html.vue"]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/05/03.html","title":"Section 5.3 Remote Desktop","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"Section 5.3 Remote Desktop","description":"some description"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"5.3.1 Remote Desktop","slug":"_5-3-1-remote-desktop","link":"#_5-3-1-remote-desktop","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"5.3.2 Remote Desktop Facts","slug":"_5-3-2-remote-desktop-facts","link":"#_5-3-2-remote-desktop-facts","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Remote Desktop Overview and Use Cases","slug":"remote-desktop-overview-and-use-cases","link":"#remote-desktop-overview-and-use-cases","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Remote Desktop Features","slug":"remote-desktop-features","link":"#remote-desktop-features","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Remote Desktop Technologies","slug":"remote-desktop-technologies","link":"#remote-desktop-technologies","children":[]}]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1736535006000},"filePathRelative":"05/03.md"}');export{d as comp,c as data};
