Different Linux distributions may have slight differences, so we&#39;re going to look at the generic boot process in this lesson. We&#39;ll examine the boot loader, the boot target, and the service files and daemons loaded during a boot-up. Configuring how the Linux system boots is a key skill for system administrators.</p><p>Linux Boot Process 00:23-00:37 To make the Linux boot process a little more digestible, we&#39;re going to break it down into the three phases that you see here. First, we&#39;re going to look at the hardware boot phase, then the bootloader phase, and we&#39;ll end with the kernel phase.</p><p>Linux Boot Process â€“ Hardware Boot Phase 00:37-01:46 With Linux or any other OS, the first step when starting the system is the hardware boot phase. When you power on your system, it goes through a process to make sure the hardware is working properly. This is the POST, or Power On Self Test, step in running your Basic Input/Output system, or BIOS. During this phase, components such as the keyboard and mouse, CPU and RAM, I/O ports, and video are tested to make sure they&#39;re all operational. If an error occurs, your system will either beep or display an error message.</p><p>Once the POST process completes, the system boot device takes control. This device may be internal storage, an optical disk, a USB device, or an SD card. The device is usually configured in the system configuration, or it can be chosen at boot time with a key press.</p><p>Up to this point, the system&#39;s startup routine is, generally, the same as other operating systems. The process then moves to the boot device to start Linux. Traditionally, systems used BIOS to configure their systems. While there are still systems configured with legacy BIOS, UEFI or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, is more secure and provides many improvements over legacy BIOS.</p><p>Bootloader Phase 01:46-02:45 Once the system&#39;s hardware has been tested, control is given to the boot device. While the boot device may differ, it contains code that allows the system to start the operating system. This is the job of the bootloader. The bootloader loads code into RAM allowing the operating system to take over control of the hardware. This code may differ from distribution to distribution and is different than other operating systems.</p><p>After the bootloader begins loading its code, it creates a temporary virtual file system in your system RAM called a RAM disk. And, depending on your distribution, this image will either be called initrd, for initial RAM disk, or initramfs, for initial RAM file system. Both perform the same function which is to load a basic image used to load the Linux OS. This image contains just enough to get things started such as loading specific drivers for networking, video, or other specific hardware in the system. At this point, the Linux kernel is started and control of the hardware is transitioned to the kernel.</p><p>Kernel Phase 02:45-03:32 Once the bootloader process completes, control has been given to the kernel. The kernel is the core of the operating system. While there are many different distros available, the Linux kernel is not significantly changed. The kernel uses the RAM disk to load all the modules required to initialize the system and load necessary daemons and other programs.</p><p>At this point, the RAM disk is no longer needed so it dismounts and destroys it to reclaim the used memory. The kernel then mounts the root file system and starts probing for new hardware and loading the appropriate drivers.</p><p>Lastly, it starts the initialization process, systemd. Systemd is used to initialize the system, define the systemd target, and whether to load additional programs and daemons. At this point, the system is considered &quot;booted&quot; and you are prompted to login.</p><p>Summary 03:32-03:45 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we reviewed the Linux boot process. We looked at the hardware boot, bootloader, and kernel phases of the boot process.</p><h2 id="_4-1-2-linux-boot-process-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-1-2-linux-boot-process-facts"><span>4.1.2 Linux Boot Process Facts</span></a></h2><p>Understanding the overall boot process can be beneficial when you need to configure boot loaders, boot targets, and service files that govern the way daemons are loaded. Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is the firmware specification that was originally used by personal computers to initiate the boot process. The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) was developed to address the shortcomings of BIOS. UEFI has replaced BIOS and is now the standard used by computer manufacturers to govern the boot process.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>UEFI boot</li><li>BIOS boot</li><li>vmlinux/vmlinuz</li></ul><h3 id="uefi-boot" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#uefi-boot"><span>UEFI Boot</span></a></h3><p>UEFI (previously known as the EFI) is a firmware specification that defines the process for booting computer systems. It is the interface between a computer system&#39;s hardware/firmware and the operating system. Some of the features provided by UEFI include the following:</p><ul><li>It provides support for larger disks using the <i class="fs-italicize">Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table</i> (GPT) partition scheme. The MBR partitioning scheme used by BIOS supported only four partitions per disk, with a maximum size of 2 TB per partition. UEFI supports a maximum partition size of 9.4 ZB (9.4 x 10 <sup>21</sup> bytes).</li><li>It provides its own boot manager. This is a significant change. The old BIOS had only enough intelligence to load a single block from the storage device. This required a multi-stage boot process. UEFI has its own command interpreter and boot manager. You no longer need a dedicated boot loader as long as you place the operating system&#39;s bootable files into the EFI system partition (ESP), which is formatted with a FAT file system.</li><li>It preserves several components from the traditional BIOS, including power management and a real-time clock.</li></ul><p>The following table identifies the phases during a UEFI boot.</p>',27),e("table",null,[e("thead",null,[e("tr",null,[e("th",null,"Phase"),e("th",null,"Process")])]),e("tbody",null,[e("tr",null,[e("td",null,"UEFI"),e("td",null,[t(" The following steps take place during the UEFI boot process: "),e("ol",null,[e("li",null," Power is supplied to the processor.
