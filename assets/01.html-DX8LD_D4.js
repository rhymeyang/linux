When Linux was first introduced in the early 1990s, it was hardly noticed. Professionals in the industry at the time were focused on the big operating systems of the day: Microsoft Windows, Novell Netware, macOS, and Unix. Since that time, things have changed dramatically. Linux is now seen worldwide in the server rooms of most major organizations. It&#39;s also started to show up more and more in the desktop market as well. That&#39;s because there are tons of Linux applications available, and most of them are free. There&#39;s growing demand for network administrators who can implement, maintain, and support Linux systems.</p><h3 id="linux-components-00-40-01-30" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-components-00-40-01-30"><span>Linux Components 00:40-01:30</span></a></h3><p>Now, the Linux OS has several components that make it unique. The kernel is the operating system&#39;s core, managing each hardware element with corresponding software. Linux libraries are collections of pre-written elements made so that programmers can perform specific functions without writing their own code. Imagine that you&#39;re a computer programmer writing an application. You have to write code that allows it to work with every type of hardware that&#39;s ever existed. But using libraries, it doesn&#39;t matter which type of hardware is installed. You call the appropriate library, and it does the rest to ensure compatibility. Okay, now let&#39;s get into interfaces.</p><p>Linux provides two different user interfaces. The first—called a graphical user interface, or GUI—looks a great deal like other operating systems that you&#39;re used to. Linux also provides a text-based command line interface. This is going to be the focus of this course since most core functions of Linux are performed there.</p><h3 id="linux-history-01-30-02-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-history-01-30-02-29"><span>Linux History 01:30-02:29</span></a></h3><p>Now, the first version of Linux was very minimal in nature. When it was released in 1991, it consisted of the Linux kernel and three basic utilities: the Bash shell, an update utility, and a compiler to write your own basic programs. Linus Torvalds, the original developer of the kernel, posted the source code for Linux online for free. With that one move, Torvalds changed the way operating systems are developed. Other programmers were welcome to create their own version. There was no secrecy, developer dominance, or limitations.</p><p>This collaborative development project continued for several years until 1994, when Linux version 1.0 was finally ready for release. The continued open-source development model has resulted in Linux being widely used around the world with over 300 regularly maintained versions. The idea behind this was that allowing programmers around the world to modify an application&#39;s source code would produce higher-quality software. Software developed with this model is frequently referred to as free or open-source software.</p><h3 id="gnu-s-not-unix-02-29-03-28" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gnu-s-not-unix-02-29-03-28"><span>GNU&#39;s Not Unix 02:29-03:28</span></a></h3><p>The Linux kernel itself is licensed under a General Public License, or GPL, with the key point being that the kernel remains freely available to anyone who wants it. You can download the Linux kernel source code, you can modify it, re-compile it, and you can run it. You can even create your own custom version, which would be called a Linux distribution. This idea of sharing source code is something that&#39;s spearheaded by the GNU foundation. GNU, by the way, is a recursive acronym for GNU&#39;s Not Unix.</p><p>The best way to think of all Linux distributions is to compare them to ice cream. Ice cream comes in a wide variety of flavors, right? But the basic formula has stayed the same. Most ice cream is made from cream, milk, sugar, and eggs. Companies that sell ice cream take this basic recipe and customize it by adding in other ingredients. Linux distributions work in much the same way. The kernel source code is comparable to the basic ice cream recipe. Because the source code is openly distributed, programmers are free to experiment with it and come up with something new.</p><h3 id="linux-distributions-03-28-04-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-distributions-03-28-04-12"><span>Linux Distributions 03:28-04:12</span></a></h3><p>Just as ice cream companies add ingredients to the ice cream recipe, programmers can enhance the Linux source code by adding specialized tools. They can even write new applications for the operating system. The result is an entirely new distribution.</p><p>And there are many, many different Linux distributions available. Programmers around the world have published theirs online. Some have developed powerful tools suited for high-end networking. Others might&#39;ve been made to run productivity applications on an end user&#39;s desktop. Either way, the result is a customized user experience. Today, there are literally hundreds of different distributions available. Some of the most popular ones are SUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat, Oracle Linux, Debian, and CentOS. Which one works best for you will depend on your needs.</p><h3 id="summary-04-12-04-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-12-04-29"><span>Summary 04:12-04:29</span></a></h3><p>And that&#39;s it for this lesson. We talked about what Linux is and how it came to be. We also went into the components that make up the Linux operating system. And then we ended this lesson by talking about the concept of a distribution.</p><h2 id="_1-1-2-linux-implementations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-1-2-linux-implementations"><span>1.1.2 Linux Implementations</span></a></h2><h3 id="linux-implementations-00-00-00-32" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-implementations-00-00-00-32"><span>Linux Implementations 00:00-00:32</span></a></h3><p>Linux is an operating system unlike most. Other OSes are often developed by for-profit organizations and have proprietary codes that make them desirable. On the other hand, Linux is developed based on the GPL or GNU Public License, meaning the Linux OS source code is freely distributable. This allows eyes from all over the world to analyze Linux and improve it.</p><p>Linux can also be configured to run as a desktop, server, and embedded system. In this lesson, we&#39;re going to review these and other Linux topics.</p><h3 id="linux-usage-00-32-01-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-usage-00-32-01-11"><span>Linux Usage 00:32-01:11</span></a></h3><p>Linux is a very stable operating system and works on various platforms. For desktop systems, hundreds of distributions called distros can be downloaded at no cost. You can even download the complete operating system source code. Further, Linux has been tested against other operating systems, and Linux performed either as well or better than most other Oses. Lastly, considering the OS cost, renewals, and other factors, Linux is much more economical, considering it rarely charges for per-seat licensing.</p><p>It&#39;s important to note that Linux doesn&#39;t require the fastest or most robust hardware to run well. Granted, should a high-performance system be required, the hardware costs between Linux and other OSes will be the same.</p><h3 id="linux-as-a-desktop-os-01-11-03-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-as-a-desktop-os-01-11-03-01"><span>Linux as a Desktop OS 01:11-03:01</span></a></h3><p>There are hundreds of Linux distributions that vary in their size and include applications. Most are generic and have similar functionality, such as web browsers, email clients, and office suites. Others are more customized for functions such as web developer, multimedia applications, and cybersecurity. There are two divisions among distributions: the Red Hat and Debian variant. While the underlying core of Linux remains the same, how the Linux system is built determines the variant. Further, the applications included help to define the distribution. Red Hat variants include Fedora and Rocky. Debian variants include Ubuntu, Kali, and Mint. There are still others, such as SUSE /openSUSE and Arch.</p><p>There are hundreds of software titles on each of these systems that can be downloaded at no cost. These include Libre Office and Open Office — compatible office suites; VLC Media player; GIMP — and GNU Image Manipulation Program that has similar functions to those found in Photoshop; and even compatible versions of the Chrome and Firefox browsers.</p><p>The Linux OS accounts for about 3% of the worldwide market share, while Windows commands about 75%. Most business desktops are standardized on the Windows OS, and they account for the large disparity between adopting a Desktop OS. Further, Linux is still looked at as a hobbyist OS with little standardization. Those that use Linux understand the versatility of Linux and the myriad of software titles that are available for the cost of a simple download. But there&#39;s no one organization that &quot;owns&quot; Linux, and many more people understand and can support the Windows OS. For organizations to standardize on Linux, they&#39;d have to change corporate culture and, potentially, leave the comfort zone of a known and proven reliable OS. Also, configuration, setup, and management are more of a manual task with Linux. However, Linux is a much better option when considering implementation, acquisition, and renewal costs.</p><h3 id="linux-as-a-server-os-03-01-03-57" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-as-a-server-os-03-01-03-57"><span>Linux as a Server OS 03:01-03:57</span></a></h3><p>Things are a bit different when it comes to utilizing Linux as a server OS. Linux is used in several specialized industries, such as space missions, websites, special effects, smartphones, etc. In general, Linux is used about 45% of the time. A Linux server is simply the same core operating system as the Linux desktop with additional server software such as DHCP, DNS, web server, database, and more. The most widely used web server software, Apache, is often deployed on Linux. MySQL and Postgres are two of the most popular database engines.</p><p>Linux can be configured with modularity, so it only runs the items required for the server role. It does this well and better than most other OSes making it very efficient and relatively easy to configure. It works just as well in different roles, such as an email server, file and print, and super-computer, and it works well with other OSes. It adapts well and can be configured to utilize its own or other authentication mechanisms.</p><h3 id="linux-on-mobile-devices-03-57-04-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-on-mobile-devices-03-57-04-41"><span>Linux on Mobile Devices 03:57-04:41</span></a></h3><p>As we&#39;ve learned, Linux can run on systems as either a workstation or a server. Linux also runs on mobile devices such as tablets and cellular phones. The Android OS developed by Google has an approximate 72% market share of the mobile OS market. There are a few reasons why Android is the market leader. First, since Linux has little to no cost, the Android OS has a low-cost point. The Linux kernel itself doesn&#39;t require much power from the CPU and has a low reliance on RAM, making it very efficient with limited resources. Lastly, there&#39;s tremendous app support. You can run almost any available app on the Android OS. The app costs are generally lower than comparable apps on other mobile devices. All in all, Android offers a lot of power in a small package.</p><h3 id="linux-virtualization-04-41-07-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-virtualization-04-41-07-29"><span>Linux Virtualization 04:41-07:29</span></a></h3><p>With normal operation, a PC usually uses less than 10% of its available resources. This is especially true with systems that utilize multi-core processors. Also, most users only run a few programs simultaneously, leaving the system&#39;s RAM largely unused. This allows your computer system to utilize more of its resources. One method you can use without any additional cost is virtualization. Virtualization has been around for many years and is the basis for cloud computing. Without it, we&#39;d require a single computer for every server task within an enterprise. That would take up quite a bit of space, generate a lot of heat, and a huge capital for maintenance, operating, and air conduction—not to mention support. Virtualization provides a greater use for the resources already owned and makes everything run more efficiently.</p><p>Using the conventional concept, without computer virtualization, the system&#39;s operating system is installed on the computer system consuming all of the processor, memory, and other system resources. Once installed, applications are installed such as a browser, word processor, email viewer, etc. Then, your data is stored on the system&#39;s internal storage. This is how most users use their computer system. There&#39;s a single piece of hardware with an operating system installed on the internal storage, and applications and data are also stored there. This is fine for most users. However, this isn&#39;t very efficient if you have a greater need.</p><p>When adding virtualization, the picture changes. Rather than installing the operating system directly on the hardware, another piece of software is installed. This software is called a hypervisor. The hypervisor is used as a middleman between the computer resources and the operating systems installed virtually.</p><p>Remember, too, that all of the computer resources are shared among all the installed virtual machines. This includes the processor, RAM, storage, NICs, and I/O. Also, there are several different hypervisors in use today. Xen and KVM are often included with most Linux distributions and are open source. VirtualBox is often used on Windows and Mac machines but is also available on Linux and Solaris and is also open source. VMware is proprietary software. It&#39;s not open source. It&#39;s used in data centers worldwide and has about 40% of the world market.</p><p>When the hypervisor is installed and configured, one or more operating systems can be installed on the system. You can have multiple copies of the same operating system, such as Windows, or different operating systems, like Windows, Rocky Linux, and OpenSUSE Linux. Each virtual machine works independently from the other, and all can run simultaneously as long as the computer system doesn&#39;t run out of system resources. Each virtual machine acts as if it was the only operating system installed and is, typically, unaware it&#39;s running virtually. The data on each virtual machine remains encapsulated within its own machine and isn&#39;t shared with other virtual machines.</p><h3 id="cloud-computing-07-29-09-50" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cloud-computing-07-29-09-50"><span>Cloud Computing 07:29-09:50</span></a></h3><p>Virtualization provides key benefits to organizations. It uses resources much more efficiently and reduces the time it takes to order new hardware, wait for delivery, then install and configure the machine from weeks to hours.</p><p>Virtualization is also the basis for cloud computing. With cloud computing, the hardware, software, and/or network resources we&#39;ve historically implemented locally and on-site are now implemented using your systems network connection. You&#39;re using the resources of another company to host your computing needs. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are two examples of this technology. You no longer purchase servers and no longer need to provide rack space, power, cooling, or maintenance on equipment. Instead, you utilize these services over the internet. The cloud services provider is now responsible for all the costs traditionally borne by your organization. You pay them for providing you with these services.</p><p>New terms have emerged and are now part of most companies&#39; vernacular. The first is IaaS or Infrastructure as a server. This is the typical model of servers and services provided to an organization. The cloud provider takes over those services and replaces traditional server rooms. Next is SaaS or software as a service. Rather than installing applications on a user&#39;s desktop, the software is provided by the service provider using a web browser. Google and Microsoft offer these services with their shared applications and office suites via web delivery. Naas, or Network as a service, provides network connectivity through the cloud. STaaS provides storage as a service. Several internet providers offer cloud storage using different methods and hosting various capacities. There&#39;s also DaaS which provides a Desktop as a Service. This is useful for organizations that utilize terminals rather than computers for desktop delivery. PaaS or platform as a service model provides an integrated solution to accomplish a specific task and may combine many other services described here.</p><p>Cloud computing has opened a whole host of opportunities for organizations. They now have the freedom to choose the model they&#39;re most comfortable with—the conventional model—where all of the server and infrastructure equipment is on-premise, goes completely into the cloud, and has the provider supply all the computing resources as a service; or, you can choose to do both and adopt a hybrid solution. The cloud isn&#39;t all or nothing and can be molded into providing computing resources in a manner you both want and are comfortable with. In addition, it can add redundancy, disaster recovery, and business continuity.</p><h3 id="embedded-linux-09-50-10-27" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#embedded-linux-09-50-10-27"><span>Embedded Linux 09:50-10:27</span></a></h3><p>Linux is everywhere as long as you know where to look. Keeping in mind that Linux is a modular operating system, you can remove all the parts that aren&#39;t needed. For example, in an embedded system, there&#39;s often no need for a customer interface. The Linux kernel has a very small footprint, perfect for embedding into a system&#39;s hardware. Intelligent devices such as televisions, IoT devices, Home internet routers, microwave ovens, etc. If you&#39;ve watched a movie or played a game aboard a plane, it was probably controlled and delivered using Linux. By removing all the unneeded components from Linux, the remaining kernel and interface are loaded onto an electronics chip and placed onto the device controller.</p><h3 id="summary-10-27-10-48" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-10-27-10-48"><span>Summary 10:27-10:48</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed the different roles that Linux can play in a typical organization. We talked about using Linux on servers, desktops, and mobile platforms. We also talked about using Linux as a hypervisor. We ended this lesson by talking about embedded Linux and cloud computing.</p><h2 id="_1-1-3-linux-introduction-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-1-3-linux-introduction-facts"><span>1.1.3 Linux Introduction Facts</span></a></h2><p>Linux has become a major player in computer networking and plays a vital role for servers and desktops—it even works with mobile devices.

Linus based his version of Linux on a Unix-like system named MINIX, which was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum. Linux version 0.02 was released in October of 1991 and consisted of the Linux kernel and its three basic utilities. These were:</p><ul><li>A Bash shell providing a command line interface.</li><li>An update utility used for flushing the file system buffers.</li><li>A GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) compiler system allowing an individual to write their own programs.</li></ul><p>The source code for the Linux operating system was shared as freeware on the internet, and others were encouraged to enhance it and make it better. At this point, Linux took on a life of its own, and it became a worldwide collaborative development project with no secrecy or tightly guarded copyrights. Access to the source code was open to anyone who wanted it. This collaborative development project on Linux continued for several years until 1994, when Linux version 1.0 was released.</p><p>The Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which requires the source code to remain freely available to anybody who wants it.

So it was something that you might experiment within a lab, but probably never consider putting into a production environment. Since that time, things have changed dramatically, and Linux is now a mainstay operating system, especially in server rooms. Using the wide variety of network services that are now available for the Linux operating system, you can configure it to perform almost any networking role that any competing server operating system can perform, including as a:</p><ul><li><p class="MsoNormal"> File server</p></li><li><p class="MsoNormal"> Print server</p></li><li><p class="MsoNormal"> Database server</p></li><li><p class="MsoNormal"> Web server</p></li><li><p class="MsoNormal"> Email server</p></li></ul><p>Linux is also slowly becoming more popular as a desktop operating system due to the many applications that are currently available.
