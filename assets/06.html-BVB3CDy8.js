This means that anyone who&#39;s sniffing the network can pick up that information and easily read it. In this lesson, we&#39;ll look at how we can use SSH port tunneling to protect our data from sniffing attacks.</p><p>Some good examples of common protocols that transmit in cleartext are the POP3 and IMAP email protocols. Users can have their email client connect to the Linux Mail Transfer Agent, or MTA, and download their emails. Again, the problem is that both of these protocols transfer data as cleartext by default. If a hacker is sniffing traffic, they can easily intercept sensitive data.</p><p>To protect our data, we should use SSH tunneling to encrypt network traffic that&#39;s normally sent as cleartext. By doing so, even if a hacker is able to intercept our traffic, all they&#39;ll see is a bunch of gibberish that&#39;s meaningless to them.</p><p>To set up an SSH tunnel, all we need to do is edit some configuration files. First, we want to edit the /etc/ssh/ssh_config file on the client side. When we open this file, we have to uncomment the appropriate directive and set the value to yes. For example, if we wanted to encrypt data between an X server and an X client to display a desktop, we&#39;d uncomment the ForwardX11 line and set the value to yes.</p><p>Alternatively, we can use the -x option when running the ssh command at the shell prompt on the client side. This encrypts the data between the X server and the X client for that SSH session. Keep in mind that you&#39;ll need to use different switches with the ssh command for other protocols and specify which port you want the encrypted traffic to go through.</p><p>On the server side, we&#39;d edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and set the appropriate directive to yes. Again, if we wanted to forward X11 traffic, we&#39;d set the X11Forwarding value here to yes. Once that&#39;s done, the X traffic between the X server and the X client system will be encrypted.</p><p>Knowing how to properly set up SSH tunneling for encryption is an important skill to master on Linux machines. Every situation will be different, so you&#39;ll need to make sure that you know which values need to be changed in your configuration files. Alternatively, if want to use SSH tunneling on just a case-by-case basis, there are different switches you can use with the ssh command to define the SSH tunnel.</p><p>Summary 02:50-03:06 And that&#39;ll wrap up this lesson on SSH port tunneling. We reviewed how you can send unencrypted traffic through an SSH tunnel to protect it from being read by an attacker.</p><h2 id="_15-6-2-configure-ssh-port-tunneling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-6-2-configure-ssh-port-tunneling"><span>15.6.2 Configure SSH Port Tunneling</span></a></h2><p>Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.</p><p>Configure SSH Port Tunneling 00:00-00:11 In this demonstration, we&#39;ll show you how to tunnel unencrypted X11 traffic over an encrypted SSH connection.</p><p>Host Configuration 00:11-00:36 We start by configuring the SSH server on the host machine to allow TCP forwarding by uncommenting the AllowTcpForwarding option in the configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config. We then start the sshd daemon with sudo systemctl start ssh and check that it&#39;s running with systemctl status ssh.</p><p>Example 00:36-01:00 Now on the client machine, we can run ssh -X ddahl@testout. If we run gedit, we see the gedit window on our machine. But when saving the file, we see it&#39;s accessing the host machine&#39;s hard disk. In fact, all the processing happens on the host machine. The client machine only gets the display, and all communication between the two is encrypted.</p><p>Summary 01:00-01:17 That&#39;s it for this demonstration. In this demonstration, we discussed tunneling an unencrypted X connection over an encrypted SSH connection and showed launching a remote X application on a local machine.</p><h2 id="_15-6-3-ssh-port-tunneling-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-6-3-ssh-port-tunneling-facts"><span>15.6.3 SSH Port Tunneling Facts</span></a></h2><p>Secure Shell (SSH) port forwarding and tunneling encrypts data from unsecure protocols and then sends the data over a network connection.

With local port forwarding, you connect to a destination server via an SSH server. Be aware of the following conditions: </p><ul><li>You enter your password to authenticate to your machine.</li><li> To establish the connection, you enter <b>ssh -L <i class="fs-italicize">port:hostname:port</i> localhost</b> in a terminal window on your client.

Remote port forwarding is the opposite of local port forwarding. Be aware of the following conditions: </p><ul><li> Modify the <b>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</b> file to include the gateway entry at the end of the file. For example, <b>GatewayPorts yes</b> allows anyone to connect to the forwarded port, <b>Gateway Ports no</b> prevents access from outside the server computer, and <b>GatewayPorts clientspecified</b> allows you to specify an IP address that connections are supported from. </li><li> Restart the SSH daemon by using the <b>sudo systemctl restart sshd</b> command. This requires that you have SSH access to the remote machine. </li><li> Enter the <b>ssh -R <i class="fs-italicize">port</i> :localhost: <i class="fs-italicize">port username@hostname</i></b> command.
