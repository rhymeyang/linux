Boot targets define how your system boots. As you may know, Microsoft Windows has this option as well. When you boot a Windows system and hit the F8 key during boot, you&#39;re presented with a boot menu and may choose the Safe Mode menu item so your system boots in a minimal system mode, allowing you to fix a problematic system. Linux has the same ability. Not only can you change how a Linux system boots, but you can also change it while it&#39;s up and running. Let&#39;s take a closer look.</p><h3 id="linux-boot-targets-00-35-00-51" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-boot-targets-00-35-00-51"><span>Linux Boot Targets 00:35-00:51</span></a></h3><p>There are several boot targets on a Linux system. Those who&#39;ve used Linux for a while may remember the init system and runlevels. The different runlevels represented how your Linux system would boot. systemd introduced another method of invoking these, but the results are almost the same.</p><h3 id="linux-boot-target-files-00-51-02-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-boot-target-files-00-51-02-07"><span>Linux Boot Target Files 00:51-02:07</span></a></h3><p>Each boot target used on your Linux system is represented by a file in the /usr/lib/systemd/system directory. All of the boot target files have a target extension.</p><p>The first boot target is poweroff.target. It&#39;s used to do what it says and shut down a system. This is synonymous with the Linux shutdown -h command. Next is rescue.target. It&#39;s used to repair a system and starts the system in single-user mode. The third is the multi-user.target This is used to start the Linux system in a normal text mode, with no graphics, sometimes called server mode. The most common target used by workstations and home enthusiasts is graphical.target. This starts Linux with a normal graphical interface. The reboot.target does what it says and is the same as the Linux shutdown -r command. Lastly is the emergency.target. It&#39;s the most minimal environment and allows system repair when rescue mode doesn&#39;t work. It mounts the system as read-only and doesn&#39;t start networking or mount any other local file system.</p><p>As shown in this table, the init boot targets are all linked files pointing to the associated systemd boot targets. These files are here to provide compatibility with older systems.</p><h3 id="switching-boot-targets-02-07-03-26" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#switching-boot-targets-02-07-03-26"><span>Switching Boot Targets 02:07-03:26</span></a></h3><p>At boot time, the system uses the default settings for your Linux system to determine which boot target to use. For most desktop systems, you may choose to use the graphical target, while servers may use the multi-user target. A couple of commands switch targets either at boot time or while a system is running. To modify how a system boots, you first must determine which target is used by default. To find out, use the systemctl get-default command. This&#39;ll display the current boot target. To change it, use the systemctl set-default target-name such as systemctl set-default multi-user.target. This only changes the configuration—it doesn&#39;t change the target. This creates a symlinked file in the /etc/systemd/system directory called default.target that points to the target specified in the set-default command. The system must be restarted for the new configuration to take effect.</p><p>To change targets on a running system, you use the systemctl isolate command. This command will immediately change a system&#39;s current target to the one specified in the command. For instance, invoking systemctl isolate multi-user will change a system running in the graphical target into the multi-user target.</p><p>In older systems, this is similar to the init command and the inittab file.</p><h3 id="summary-03-26-03-51" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-03-26-03-51"><span>Summary 03:26-03:51</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we introduced you to the concept of a boot target under systemd. We first talked about what a boot target is. Then we reviewed several of the key boot targets that are used on a Linux system. Then we talked about how to change boot targets. And then, we finally ended this lesson by discussing how to switch boot targets.</p><h2 id="_4-3-2-managing-boot-targets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-3-2-managing-boot-targets"><span>4.3.2 Managing Boot Targets</span></a></h2><h3 id="manage-boot-targets-00-00-00-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#manage-boot-targets-00-00-00-19"><span>Manage Boot Targets 00:00-00:19</span></a></h3><p>In this demonstration, we&#39;re going to spend some time learning how to manage Linux boot targets. Linux used to use runlevels, not boot targets, to determine the operating system state at bootup. With the widespread adoption of systemd, targets now manage the system state.</p><h3 id="boot-target-unit-files-00-19-02-40" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#boot-target-unit-files-00-19-02-40"><span>Boot Target Unit Files 00:19-02:40</span></a></h3><p>Each boot target is represented by a unit file in the file system. The default location for these files is /usr/lib/systemd/system. This directory also has unit files for other systemd components, but we&#39;ll focus on the files with the .target extension in this demo. As you can see, there are many files here with that extension. Let&#39;s get started.</p><p>We&#39;ll begin with the graphical.target file. The &quot;graphical&quot; part of the unit filename is in reference to the graphical user interface, which starts up as part of this file. This puts the system into a multi-user mode, meaning that multiple people can be logged in at the same time. The file also enables networking on the system. Now, the multi-user target file does the same thing, except it doesn&#39;t use a graphical user interface. Instead, it uses a text-based user interface. Note, though, that just because a target doesn&#39;t start the GUI itself, it can be started manually by an administrator. So I can have the system boot into the multi-user target, but start the GUI if I need. The graphical target is typically run on workstations where end users want a GUI experience. You&#39;ll typically see the multi-user target on Linux servers, where there&#39;s no need to have a GUI.</p><p>Now, the rescue target—defined by the rescue.target unit file—is used to repair a broken Linux system. That&#39;s because the rescue target only allows a single user to log in, and networking isn&#39;t enabled. Also, there&#39;s no GUI with this target, either.</p><p>There are two other boot targets to note here. If you use reboot.target to set the system state—as its name implies—it&#39;ll simply reboot the system. There&#39;s also poweroff.target. If you use this file to set the state, the system shuts it down.</p><p>Now, there are seven other boot target files that you can use to set the system state: runlevel0 through runlevel6. These are symbolic links to other unit files. Like we talked about initially, runlevels are from the older init system daemon that was used before systemd. All in all, they&#39;re pretty similar to boot targets. The runlevel0.target file points to poweroff.target. Runlevel6.target points to reboot.target. The runlevel2 through runlevel4 files point to multi-user.target, and runlevel5.target points to graphical.target.</p><h3 id="default-boot-target-02-40-03-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#default-boot-target-02-40-03-49"><span>Default Boot Target 02:40-03:49</span></a></h3><p>Unlike runlevels, systemd.targets aren&#39;t mutually exclusive, meaning you can have more than one target running at a time. If I execute the systemctl list-units --type=target --state=active command, I can see that there are several running simultaneously. To determine which is the default boot target—which will load several others as well—I execute systemctl get-default. This system is configured to boot to the graphical target.</p><p>If we list the contents of the /usr/lib/systemd/system directory using ls -l, we can see that the default target is actually a symbolic link that points to graphical.target. We can change this with the systemctl command. For example, let&#39;s say that we want to modify this system so that it boots without a graphical interface. To do that, we enter systemctl set-default and then the name of the boot target we want to use as the default. In this case, let&#39;s set it to multi-user.target.</p><h3 id="change-targets-03-49-04-26" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#change-targets-03-49-04-26"><span>Change Targets 03:49-04:26</span></a></h3><p>You can also use the systemctl command to change the system state to a different boot target. Let&#39;s suppose that we want to change to multi-user.target now, where we&#39;ll have a text-based interface instead. To do this, we enter systemctl isolate multi-user.</p><p>Notice that the system state has changed. We&#39;re no longer running a GUI, but networking is still enabled. And the multi-user nature of the OS hasn&#39;t changed, either. We&#39;ve just shed the graphical interface part. I&#39;ll quickly switch it back to the graphical interface again with sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target.</p><h3 id="summary-04-26-04-48" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-26-04-48"><span>Summary 04:26-04:48</span></a></h3><p>And that does it for this demonstration.
