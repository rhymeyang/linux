There are two different shell commands to do this. The first is pwd, and the other one is cd. Let&#39;s begin by looking at how to use pwd.</p><h3 id="the-pwd-command-00-17-00-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pwd-command-00-17-00-38"><span>The pwd Command 00:17-00:38</span></a></h3><p>The pwd command stands for present working directory, although some people call it print working directory. The command is used to display the current directory you&#39;re working in on the screen. This can be useful if the shell profile hasn&#39;t been configured to automatically display the current directory as part of the shell prompt.</p><h3 id="the-pwd-command-00-38-01-43" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pwd-command-00-38-01-43"><span>The pwd Command 00:38-01:43</span></a></h3><p>The syntax for using pwd is very simple. Typing pwd in your terminal screen displays your current directory on the screen. I have entered the pwd command, and it tells me that my current directory is /home/rtracy. My prompt is configured on this system to display three different pieces of information. First, it tells me my username, who I&#39;m currently logged in to the system as. It also tells me the hostname of my system. And then, finally, it tells me what my current directory is.</p><p>Notice, here, that pwd says I&#39;m in /home/rtracy, but my prompt says that I am in tilde (~). Remember, the tilde character references the /home directory of whatever user is currently logged in. In this case, I&#39;m logged in as rtracy, so tilde points to /home/rtracy. If I were logged in as a different user then I would still see the tilde in the prompt, but it would point to an entirely different user&#39;s home directory.</p><h3 id="the-cd-command-01-43-01-59" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-cd-command-01-43-01-59"><span>The cd Command 01:43-01:59</span></a></h3><p>Once you know where you&#39;re at in the file system, you also need to know how to change to a different directory. Do this using the cd command at the shell prompt. Enter cd followed by the name of the directory that you want to switch to, which can be done two different ways.</p><h3 id="the-cd-command-with-a-relative-path-01-59-02-45" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-cd-command-with-a-relative-path-01-59-02-45"><span>The cd Command with a Relative Path 01:59-02:45</span></a></h3><p>First, you can enter cd and then the name of a directory without specifying the full path to that directory. This is interpreted as specifying a subdirectory of the current directory. That&#39;s shown here in this example.</p><p>Here we&#39;ve entered the cd temp command. Because we did not specify a full path, the cd command is going to switch to a sub-directory of the current directory, whatever that may be, named temp. Here we use the pwd command to verify that we truly did switch to the right directory. We switched to /home/rtracy/temp.</p><p>This is called using a relative path. The path specified within the command is relative to some other point in the file system, which, in this case, is the current directory.</p><h3 id="the-cd-command-with-a-absolute-path-02-45-03-36" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-cd-command-with-a-absolute-path-02-45-03-36"><span>The cd Command with a Absolute Path 02:45-03:36</span></a></h3><p>You can also use absolute paths with the cd command. To use an absolute path, specify the full path to the directory that you want to change to, starting with the root directory, which is forward slash (/). You can see an example of that right here. In this example, we enter the cd command, and then we start at the top of the file system, forward slash (/), and then we provide the full path to the directory that we want to change to.</p><p>We&#39;re telling cd to switch us to the /home/rtracy/temp directory. This command works from any directory because the cd command really wouldn&#39;t care what the current directory is. We&#39;ve specified the full path to the directory that we want to change to, which is calculated from the /root directory. And here you can see that the current directory was changed to that path.</p><h3 id="move-to-a-higher-directory-03-36-04-56" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#move-to-a-higher-directory-03-36-04-56"><span>Move to a Higher Directory 03:36-04:56</span></a></h3><p>You can also use the cd command to move up levels in the file system hierarchy. You do this by entering cd .. [cd space dot dot] to change the current directory to the next level higher in the hierarchy. You can see that here. We were in the /temp directory. We type cd .. and go up one level to the user&#39;s /home directory. We were in /home/rtracy/temp. We typed cd .. and now we&#39;re in /home/rtracy.</p><p>Make sure you insert a space right here, between the cd command and the two dots. If you forget that space and you type cd.. with no space in between, this bash shell is going to think that you want to run a cd.. command. It will look through the file system and say, &quot;I don&#39;t have a cd.. command.&quot; Always remember to put that space in there.</p><p>In the second example, here, we&#39;ve moved up two levels in the file system hierarchy. Notice that we typed cd ../.. to go up one level, and then go up one more. Because we were in the /home/rtracy directory after we typed the second command, we&#39;re taken up two levels to the root of the file system, this forward slash (/).</p><h3 id="the-ls-command-04-56-05-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-ls-command-04-56-05-07"><span>The ls Command 04:56-05:07</span></a></h3><p>Next, let&#39;s talk about how to list the files and subdirectories that reside within a given directory. This is done using the ls command. Let&#39;s take a look at how it works.</p><h3 id="the-ls-command-05-07-06-13" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-ls-command-05-07-06-13"><span>The ls Command 05:07-06:13</span></a></h3><p>If you just enter ls at the shell prompt, as in this first example, then the contents of the current directory are listed on the screen. You can see that my current directory is the /root directory of the file system, forward slash (/). When I type the ls command, all of the files and all of the subdirectories located in the /root directory of the file system are displayed. These are listed right here.</p><p>This is an example of a relative path. Because we just typed the ls command with no other directory listed as an argument, it assumed that we wanted to look at the current directory.</p><p>In the second example, though, we provide an absolute path of the directory we want to look at with the ls command. In this case, we view the contents of the /home/rtracy directory, which are then displayed on the screen. Because we specified the full path to the directory that we want to look at, the ls command doesn&#39;t care what the current directory is. We told it to start at the root, go down to /home, and then go to /rtracy and display whatever is in there.</p><h3 id="ls-command-options-06-13-06-52" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ls-command-options-06-13-06-52"><span>ls Command Options 06:13-06:52</span></a></h3><p>The ls command includes several useful options that you should be familiar with. You can see what they are by viewing the man page for ls. However, there are two critical ones to know.</p><p>The first option is -a which tells ls to display all files. By default the ls command doesn&#39;t display hidden files within the directory. To view the hidden files use the ls -a option.</p><p>The second option uses -l to display a long listing of the directory contents. By using ls -l, we can see more detailed file information, such as the permissions that are assigned to that file directory.</p><h3 id="summary-06-52-07-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-06-52-07-12"><span>Summary 06:52-07:12</span></a></h3><p>In this lesson, we talked about how to use the pwd command to view the current directory. We talked about using the cd command to change the current directory, and then we ended this lesson by talking about the ls command to list files in a directory.</p><h2 id="_2-8-2-navigate-directories" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-8-2-navigate-directories"><span>2.8.2 Navigate Directories</span></a></h2><h3 id="navigate-directories-00-00-00-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#navigate-directories-00-00-00-10"><span>Navigate Directories 00:00-00:10</span></a></h3><p>In this demonstration, we&#39;re going to look at several shell commands you can use to navigate directories within the Linux file system.</p><h3 id="use-pwd-00-10-01-02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-pwd-00-10-01-02"><span>Use pwd 00:10-01:02</span></a></h3><p>The first command we&#39;ll look at is the pwd command, which stands for print working directory. The purpose of this command is to show you the directory in which you are currently working. This is a useful command because the prompt used in a terminal may not always be configured to show the directory you are currently working in.</p><p>Here, you see that my prompt is showing the name of the user I&#39;m logged in as, which is jsmith, and the name of this host, which is myubuntu. Although it&#39;s not obvious, the tilde (~) included in the prompt means that I&#39;m in the home directory of the user currently logged in to the system.</p><p>When you first open a terminal, you&#39;re taken to your home directory by default. If you&#39;re not sure what your home directory is, you can view it by running pwd. As you can see, jsmith&#39;s home directory is /home/jsmith.</p><p>The pwd command can be used to show the full path to the directory you&#39;re currently working in.</p><h3 id="ls-command-01-02-01-31" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ls-command-01-02-01-31"><span>ls Command 01:02-01:31</span></a></h3><p>The next command is the ls command. This command is one that all Linux users must know how to use. The ls command displays all the files and subdirectories within the specified directory.</p><p>When I run ls in my home directory, I&#39;m shown all the files and subdirectories that exist in that directory. With this distribution, items that are listed in blue are directories, and files are shown in black. Other files, such as executable files, may use different colors, as can be seen by the gzip file.</p><h3 id="use-ls-l-01-31-01-52" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-ls-l-01-31-01-52"><span>Use <code>ls -l</code> 01:31-01:52</span></a></h3><p>Notice that when I ran ls, it only listed the names of the files and directories. If you need to view more information about these, then you can run ls -l. The l stands for long listing. From this output, I can now see other details, such as what access permissions have been set, the owning user and group, and the date the items were created.</p><h3 id="use-ls-a-01-52-02-27" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-ls-a-01-52-02-27"><span>Use <code>ls -a</code> 01:52-02:27</span></a></h3><p>Keep in mind that, by default, you see regular standard files and subdirectories when you run the ls command. However, there are other files and subdirectories within Linux that ls doesn&#39;t display by default, especially in a user&#39;s home directory, such as hidden files used to configure the environment.</p><p>To view these hidden files and directories along with the regular files and directories you run ls with the -a option. The hidden files and directories are now shown with a period in front of their name. If you want to view the information in long format and see the hidden files and directories, you can run ls -al or ls -la.</p><h3 id="sort-ls-02-27-03-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sort-ls-02-27-03-08"><span>Sort <code>ls</code> 02:27-03:08</span></a></h3><p>The ability to sort the results is another very useful <code>ls</code> command option. This can be done using the <code>--sort</code> option.</p><p>For example, when I do an <code>ls -l</code> again, you see that the contents are listed in alphabetical order. But I may want to know which of all these files and folders are taking up the most space on my disk.</p><p>To do that, I&#39;ll run <code>ls -l --sort=</code> and then specify that I want to sort by size by typing size. Now, when I press Enter, the listing is sorted by size with the largest file, my gzip file, at the top. Other options for sorting include thigs such as time, version, and extension.</p><h3 id="use-relative-paths-03-08-04-22" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-relative-paths-03-08-04-22"><span>Use Relative Paths 03:08-04:22</span></a></h3><p>All right. As we discuss the next few commands, we&#39;re going to work with various locations, or paths. Before we jump into those commands, let&#39;s discuss relative and absolute paths for a second.</p><p>A relative path means that you are starting from your current directory. For example, when I run the ls command, I&#39;m shown all the files and directories that are in or relative to the home directory I&#39;m currently in.</p><p>When using relative paths, there are two special symbols to distinguish which location you want to move from. A period is used to indicate that you are starting from your current location. Two periods mean that you want to start in the parent directory.</p><p>For example, to view the contents of the subdirectory named Public, I&#39;ll run ls ./Public. And when I press Enter, I&#39;m shown the contents of that subdirectory. To view the contents of the parent directory, I&#39;ll run ls .., and I&#39;m shown what&#39;s in the /home directory. You can include multiple sets of double periods to move up the directory tree as needed.</p><p>For example, to view the contents of the root directory from within my home directory, I&#39;ll run ls ../.. The first set of periods takes me to the home directory, while the second set takes me back one more directory, to the root of the file system.</p><h3 id="use-absolute-paths-04-22-05-00" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-absolute-paths-04-22-05-00"><span>Use Absolute Paths 04:22-05:00</span></a></h3><p>Although relative paths can get you to just about anywhere you want to go, they can be confusing. In some cases, the command you&#39;re running may require an absolute path. An absolute path, or full path, always starts from the root of your system. This means that all absolute paths start with a forward slash (/). For example, instead of using a series of periods to list the contents of the root directory, I can run ls / instead, where the forward slash means the root.</p><p>As another example, I can use ls /home/jsmith/Public to view the contents of the Public directory even though I&#39;m currently in my home directory.</p><h3 id="use-cd-05-00-06-09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-cd-05-00-06-09"><span>Use <code>cd</code> 05:00-06:09</span></a></h3><p>With that understanding of relative and absolute paths, the next command I want to show you is the cd command, or the change directory command. As the name implies, this command lets you move or change from your current directory to a different directory.</p><p>For example, to change from my home directory to the public directory, I&#39;ll run cd Public. Now, when I run pwd, you see that my current directory is /home/jsmith/Public. In this example, the cd command used a relative path. Now, to move back to my home directory using the cd command, I&#39;ll run cd .. and press Enter. Notice how I used the two periods, as we discussed earlier.</p><p>If you need to move further down the directory tree, you can just add additional forward slashes and the names of the directories. For example, even though I&#39;m in my home directory, I can run cd Public/Sales to jump directly to the Sales directory. Likewise, you can use cd with an absolute path, such as cd /etc/hp. As you can see, this command took me directly to the root and then up to the etc/hp directory.</p><h3 id="cd-shortcuts-06-09-06-30" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cd-shortcuts-06-09-06-30"><span>cd Shortcuts 06:09-06:30</span></a></h3><p>The cd command also has some handy shortcuts that you can use. For example, since I&#39;m no longer in my home directory, I could get back there using the tilde character by running cd ~.</p><p>Now let&#39;s switch back to the hp directory so I can show you another quick way to get back to your home directory. You can do this if you run cd with no other options. This takes you back to your home directory as well.</p><h3 id="use-tree-06-30-07-58" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-tree-06-30-07-58"><span>Use tree 06:30-07:58</span></a></h3><p>The last command I want to show you is the tree command. This command lists the contents of the directories in a tree-like format. There are many options available with this command, but I&#39;ll just show you a few to give you an idea of how this works.</p><p>Be aware that not all distributions come with this utility preinstalled.</p><p>The simplest use of this command is to just run tree. When I run this from my home directory, notice how it shows me everything in this directory, like ls did. But it also shows me all the subdirectories and their files.</p><p>For example, in the Public directory, you see all of its files and directories as well as the files listed in the Sales subdirectory. Notice that, at the bottom, it also shows a summary of the number of directories and files found in this path.</p><p>As we saw earlier, when discussing the ls command, there are several hidden files and directories in your home directory. These can also be seen using the tree command, by running tree -a. To make it easier to view the results, I&#39;ll add | more and press Enter. As I press the spacebar, we can see there are a lot of hidden directories listed along with their files.</p><p>The last two options I want to show you are -f and -d. The -f option prints the full path prefix for each file, while the -d option tells tree to only show directories. To see this, let&#39;s run tree -d. Notice that none of the files are shown. Now, let&#39;s run it again using both -d and -f. With -f, you can see the relative path for each directory.</p><h3 id="summary-07-58-08-22" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-07-58-08-22"><span>Summary 07:58-08:22</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this demonstration. In this demo, we looked at several different commands that you can use to navigate the Linux file system. First, we looked at the pwd and ls commands and then discussed the differences between relative and absolute paths, including the use of the tilde. Next, we discussed the cd command. We ended with a demonstration of the tree command.</p><h2 id="_2-8-3-directory-management" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-8-3-directory-management"><span>2.8.3 Directory Management</span></a></h2><h3 id="directory-management-00-00-00-22" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#directory-management-00-00-00-22"><span>Directory Management 00:00-00:22</span></a></h3><p>In this lesson, we&#39;re going to review how you manage directories within the Linux file system. Let&#39;s begin by discussing how to create and delete directories. Let&#39;s first look at how you create a new directory and the shell commands you can use to manage the directories within the Linux file system.</p><h3 id="the-mkdir-command-00-22-01-31" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-mkdir-command-00-22-01-31"><span>The mkdir Command 00:22-01:31</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s first look at how you go about creating a new directory. This is done by using the mkdir command, M-K-D-I-R. We type mkdir followed by the name of the directory we want to create. In this example, we created a new directory named docs. We used the ls command to verify that the new directory was created.</p><p>This is an example of using a relative path. We didn&#39;t specify where docs was supposed to go; therefore, the mkdir command assumed that it would go into the current directory, which, as you can see, is my user&#39;s /home directory.</p><p>You could use an absolute path with the mkdir command. An example is shown here. If we specify an absolute path and the mkdir command doesn&#39;t care what the current directory is, it makes the directory we specify in the path that we specify. In this example, we wanted to create a new directory named backup, which needed to be created at the root of the file system. To do this, we entered mkdir /backup.</p><h3 id="the-mkdir-–p-option-01-31-02-24" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-mkdir-–p-option-01-31-02-24"><span>The <code>mkdir –p</code> Option 01:31-02:24</span></a></h3><p>If you&#39;re creating a directory using an absolute path, like in the previous example, but the path that we specified in the command doesn&#39;t exist yet, then you can use the -p option with the mkdir command. The -p option tells the mkdir command to specify that the entire directory path within the command be created if it doesn&#39;t already exist. In this example, I&#39;ve typed mkdir /backups/monthly/February.</p><p>If backups and monthly already existed, then it would just create the February directory. But let&#39;s suppose that /backups and /backups/monthly don&#39;t already exist. By adding the -p option, the mkdir command will create /backups, then it will create /monthly, and finally, it will create the /February directory.</p><h3 id="the-cp-command-02-24-03-33" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-cp-command-02-24-03-33"><span>The cp Command 02:24-03:33</span></a></h3><p>In addition to creating and viewing directories in the Linux file system using shell commands, you can also copy, move, or delete them. One command you can use to do this is the cp command, the copy command. This utility&#39;s used to copy directories or entire directory structures from one location to another.</p><p>If you need to copy an entire directory structure, use the -R option with cp. This specifies that the directory contents be copied recursively. In this example, we run cp -R, and then we specify the name of the directory that we want to copy. This is the source.</p><p>In this case, we&#39;re going to copy my entire home directory. I&#39;ve specified ~/. I have to specify where I want that directory copied. In this case, I&#39;ve specified an absolute path where I want that directory copied which is /backups/monthly/February. This command will copy my user&#39;s home directory and any sub-directories and files within it to /backups/monthly/February.</p><h3 id="the-mv-command-03-33-04-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-mv-command-03-33-04-19"><span>The mv Command 03:33-04:19</span></a></h3><p>You can also use the mv command to manage directories. The mv command will copy a directory that you specify to a new location in the file system. But there&#39;s one key difference between mv and cp. The mv command moves the directories. That means that the original directory—the source directory—will get deleted.</p><p>In this example, I&#39;m going to move a directory within my /home directory named /docs. I&#39;m going to move it from my /home directory to the absolute path specified here: /backups/monthly/February. Because we&#39;re moving this time instead of copying, this directory will be deleted from its source location after it&#39;s been moved to its new location.</p><h3 id="rename-a-directory-04-19-05-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rename-a-directory-04-19-05-04"><span>Rename a Directory 04:19-05:04</span></a></h3><p>The move command doesn&#39;t only move directories but can also rename directories. When we use move to rename directories, we&#39;re moving the directory to the same directory where it already existed and changing its name.</p><p>To do this, you simply type mv followed by the source directory—the one you want to rename—and then the new directory name you want to apply. In this case, we&#39;re going to change the name of the docs directory in my user&#39;s home directory to documents.</p><p>Notice that we&#39;re not changing its location in the file system structure. That directory is going to stay in my user&#39;s home directory. Even though we&#39;re technically moving the directory and keeping it in the same location where it originally was, we&#39;re essentially just renaming it.</p><h3 id="the-rmdir-command-05-04-05-57" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-rmdir-command-05-04-05-57"><span>The rmdir Command 05:04-05:57</span></a></h3><p>There may be times when you need to remove a directory entirely from the file system. There are two different ways you can do this. The first one is to use the rmdir command. As its name implies, rmdir is used to remove directories. Simply type rmdir followed by the directory name that you want to delete.

In this case, we specified that the docs directory is in my user&#39;s home directory. It&#39;s important to note that the rmdir command requires that the directory you want to delete must be empty before it will delete it.</p><h3 id="empty-directory-requirement-05-57-06-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#empty-directory-requirement-05-57-06-38"><span>Empty Directory Requirement 05:57-06:38</span></a></h3><p>An example of this is shown here. Notice that I got an error message when I used the rmdir command to try to delete the docs directory in my user&#39;s home directory. It says, &quot;rmdir failed to remove the directory because it&#39;s not empty.&quot; There are two options you can use in this situation.</p><p>One is to go into that directory using the cd command and delete all the files and subdirectories already within it. Once you do that, then you can use rmdir. This can be a time-consuming solution because you&#39;ll find that the directory you want to remove has files in it, along with subdirectories and more files within that.</p><h3 id="the-rm-command-06-38-07-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-rm-command-06-38-07-14"><span>The <code>rm</code> Command 06:38-07:14</span></a></h3><p>A better option is to use the rm command.

We also talked about using the rmdir command to delete an empty directory. Then we ended this lesson by talking about the rm command, which can be used to delete a directory that already has items within it.</p><h2 id="_2-8-4-manage-directories" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-8-4-manage-directories"><span>2.8.4 Manage Directories</span></a></h2><h3 id="manage-directories-00-00-00-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#manage-directories-00-00-00-10"><span>Manage Directories 00:00-00:10</span></a></h3><p>In this demonstration, we are going to spend time looking at several shell commands that are used to manage directories in the Linux file system.</p><h3 id="create-new-directories-00-10-01-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#create-new-directories-00-10-01-11"><span>Create New Directories 00:10-01:11</span></a></h3><p>We are going to start with the mkdir command. M-K-D-I-R, as its name implies, this command creates new directories. Suppose we want to create a new directory in the home directory called mynewfiles. We would type mkdir mynewfiles and press Enter. When we run the &#39;ls&#39; command, we see that a new directory is created. Because we did not explicitly specify a path for mynewfiles, the mkdir command assumed we wanted to create the directory in the current working directory. To create it somewhere else in the file system, we would have to specify the full path, starting at the root. For example, we could type mkdir /tmp/rockcollection. We used an explicit path that started at the root, and we worked our way down the file system to the specific directory we wanted to create. This command created a new directory in the /tmp directory. We can verify by typing ls /tmp, and we see a directory called rockcollection now created.</p><h3 id="remove-directories-01-11-02-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#remove-directories-01-11-02-29"><span>Remove Directories 01:11-02:29</span></a></h3><p>In addition to creating directories, we can also remove directories. There are two different utilities that you can use to remove directories. One is called rmdir. As its name implies, this is used to remove directories. rmdir will only delete a directory if that directory is empty. The directory cannot have any files or subdirectories within it. In our home folder, we have a directory named temp. We run ls temp and see it has five files within it. If we enter rmdir temp, the command fails. Why? Because the directory is not empty.</p><p>At this point, we have two options. One would be to manually delete all the files and subdirectories and then run rmdir again. This would take a lot of time. Or we can use a different utility called rm. The rm command is used to remove files and directories. It will remove a directory with contents in it if you specify the -r option. rm -r will not prompt by default before removing subdirectories and files within the directory you specify. There are options we can use with rm to require it to prompt before removing anything. But if we only specify -r, we will not be prompted. Let&#39;s enter rm -r temp. When we run the ls command, the temp directory is gone.</p><h3 id="copy-directories-02-29-04-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#copy-directories-02-29-04-01"><span>Copy Directories 02:29-04:01</span></a></h3><p>Next, we will look at the cp utility. This is used to copy directories. Within the home directory, we created a directory called mynewfiles. When we go into mynewfiles, we see that it is empty. Let&#39;s use the touch command to quickly make several empty zero-byte files in this folder. When we run the ls command, we see that we have five files within mynewfiles. Let&#39;s create two new directories called &#39;otherfiles&#39; and &#39;someotherfiles&#39;. I&#39;ll run ls and we see the files we created, as well as the empty subdirectories.</p><p>Let&#39;s navigate to the parent directory by typing cd .. to navigate up one directory. Suppose we need to copy mynewfiles along with all the files and subdirectories within it to a different location in the file system. We use the cp command to accomplish this. To copy all the contents of mynewfiles, we use the -R option, which configures the cp command to copy files and subdirectories recursively. I&#39;ll run the command: ls -R /tmp/. We see the mynewfiles directory was copied over as well as the files and subdirectories within it.</p><p>When we run, rm -r /tmp/mynewfiles, we remove the directory from the /tmp directory. When we list the contents of our home directory, we see the folder still exists there. Copying a file or directory will duplicate it to the location specified in the cp command. We can also move a folder from one location in the file system to another.</p><h3 id="move-folders-04-01-04-35" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#move-folders-04-01-04-35"><span>Move Folders 04:01-04:35</span></a></h3><p>When you move files or directories, the original source is deleted and is moved over to a new location. This is done using the mv command. Let&#39;s move the mynewfiles directory to the /tmp directory. Run, mv mynewfiles /tmp/mynewfiles. If we run the ls command, we see mynewfiles is gone from the local directory. We run ls -R on the /tmp directory. We see that mynewfiles has been moved there.</p><h3 id="summary-04-35-04-45" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-35-04-45"><span>Summary 04:35-04:45</span></a></h3><p>In this demonstration, we looked at several different commands used to manage directories in the Linux file system.</p><h2 id="_2-8-5-directory-management-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-8-5-directory-management-facts"><span>2.8.5 Directory Management Facts</span></a></h2><p>Navigating within and making changes to the directory structure are tasks you will frequently perform when using a Linux system.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Navigate a Linux directory</li><li>Create, copy, and move a Linux directory</li><li>Remove a Linux directory</li></ul><h3 id="navigate-a-linux-directory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#navigate-a-linux-directory"><span>Navigate a Linux Directory</span></a></h3><p>The following table describes basic commands to navigate within a Linux directory.</p>',140),e("table",{id:"table1"},[e("thead",null,[e("tr",null,[e("th",null,"Command"),e("th",null,"Description"),e("th",null,"Examples")])]),e("tbody",null,[e("tr",null,[e("td",null,[e("b",null,"pwd")]),e("td",null,"Displays the current working directory."),e("td",{valign:"top"},[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t("If a user named fred is currently in his home directory and types "),e("b",null,"pwd"),t(" at the shell prompt, "),e("i",null,"/home/fred"),t(" is displayed.")])])])]),e("tr",null,[e("td",null,[e("b",null,"cd")]),e("td",null,[t("Changes the present working directory.
