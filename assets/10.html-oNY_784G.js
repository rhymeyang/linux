It does this by encrypting the data sent between systems and using digital certificates to ensure that only the intended recipients can view and use the data sent.</p><p>For example, SSL is often used to secure communications between your web browser and a web server.</p><p>An SSL VPN is a type of virtual private network that uses the SSL protocol or the Transport Layer Security protocol to provide secure remote-access VPN capability. However, in most cases, Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is used since the Internet Engineering Task Force deprecated SSL. Although TLS is most often used, most people still refer to them together, as SSL/TLS.</p><p>The Transport Layer Security protocol is an improved version of SSL. It ensures that messages being transmitted on the internet are private and tamper-proof.</p><p>To set up your SSL/TLS installation, you must define the channels that connect your systems to use SSL or TLS. You&#39;ll also have to create and manage your digital certificates. Once everything is set up, you can test your SSL or TLS conditions using self signed certificates.</p><p>Be aware, however, that self-signed certificates cannot be revoked, which could allow an attacker to spoof an identity after a private key has been compromised. So only use these types of certificates for testing.</p><p>OpenSSL is a command line tool that&#39;s installed on many Linux distribution by default; and, of course, you can also download and install it yourself.</p><p>With OpenSSL, you can create and view certificates and test your SSL/TLS connections.</p><p>IPSec Transport Mode 02:18-03:19 Internet Protocol Security, or IPSec, is an extension to the IP protocol. Like SSL, it secures sessions between computers by validating and encrypting the packets of data that are sent across a network.</p><p>When setting up and using IPSec, it&#39;s important to understand that IPSec has two modes, transport mode and tunnel mode.</p><p>In transport mode, only the payload of the IP packet is encrypted, and the original IP headers are left intact.</p><p>This mode has the advantage of adding only a few bytes to each packet. But it also allows devices on the public network to see the final source and destination of the packet. However, by passing the IP header as unencrypted data, transport mode allows an attacker to perform some traffic analysis.</p><p>This mode is often used for end-to-end communications, such as communication between a client and a server or a workstation and a gateway acting as a host.</p><p>For example, this mode is suited to use with an encrypted Telnet session from a workstation to a router in which the router is the actual destination.</p><p>IPSec Tunnel Mode 03:19-04:14 However, when working with VPNs, IPSec is normally used in tunnel mode, which is the default mode.</p><p>In tunnel mode, the entire original IP packet is protected by IPSec. This means that IPSec wraps and encrypts the original packet and then adds a new IP header, which is then sent on to the other side of the VPN tunnel.</p><p>You can really see one of tunnel mode&#39;s benefits while using NAT routers.</p><p>A NAT router lets users or a company using private IP address send their data across the internet using a public IP address generated by the NAT router.</p><p>The problem with NAT and IPSec is that NAT modifies the contents of the IP packet. As a result, these packets are rejected by the receiving target because the signature is wrong.</p><p>If you use tunnel mode and NAT, this concern disappears because once the NAT information is stripped off, the original IP packet is sent on, and the signatures will still match.</p><p>Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 04:14-06:18 The last VPN protocol we need to discuss is the Datagram Transport Layer Security protocol, or DTLS.</p><p>DTLS is based on the TLS protocol and provides security for datagram-based applications by allowing them to communicate using a method designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.</p><p>The main difference between DTSL and TLS is that DTLS uses UDP, and TLS uses TCP.</p><p>TLS relies on TCP to guarantee that the packet was delivered correctly in the event that the packet was fragmented, reordered, or lost.</p><p>Getting rid of anyone of these TCP features would normally break the TLS crypto logic but DTLS has created it&#39;s own solution or work around for each. First, we have message fragmentation.</p><p>Fragmentation occurs when a packet datagram is too large to fit within the maximum transmission unit (MTU).</p><p>Although TCP has a way to fix this issue; UDP does not. However, DTSL resolves this issue by introducing its own fragmentation offset and length value in the DTLS message itself. This ensure that both ends of the communication are provided fragmentation information, regardless of the underlying transport.</p><p>Next, we have message reordering. With TCP, if a packet arrives out of order, it uses sequence numbering to ensure that the original data is reassembled properly. If the reassembly is not performed correctly, then the packet can&#39;t be properly decrypted.</p><p>DTLS solves this problem by adding its own sequence numbering to the application, allowing it to be independent of the underlying transport technology.</p><p>And, finally, we have the issue of lost packets. With TCP, if a packet is lost, it tells the sender to resend the lost packet. UTP can&#39;t do this. DTLS fixes this problem by adding a simple retransmission timer to its application logic, allowing it to retransmit packets without relying on the transport protocol.</p><p>One disadvantage of using DTLS is that these built-in recovery functions requires additional memory.</p><p>Summary 06:18-06:44 That&#39;s it for this lesson.</p><p>In this lesson, we introduced VPN as a client and then explained the role SSL/TLS plays in a VPN connection.</p><p>We also explained how an IPSec VPN works, including its transport mode and tunnel mode.</p><p>And we ended this lesson by discussing how using DTLS VPNs with DTLS overcomes the weaknesses of TCP features.</p><h2 id="_15-10-2-configuring-vpn-access-and-authentication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-10-2-configuring-vpn-access-and-authentication"><span>15.10.2 Configuring VPN Access and Authentication</span></a></h2><p>Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.</p><p>Configure VPN Access and Authentication 00:00-00:19 In this demo, we&#39;re going to explore how to create an IPsec VPN using Ubuntu 22.04&#39;s GUI. Now, to configure IPsec VPNs in Ubuntu, we need to have the network manager L2TP gnome package installed first.</p><p>Graphical Method 00:19-00:33 Let&#39;s open the Settings app and select the Network menu. You&#39;ll be able to see the VPN option in the main window. To add a new VPN configuration, select the plus sign.</p><p>IPsec VPN 00:33-00:52 IPsec is more secure than an SSL VPN, so that&#39;s one reason to choose this method. When you configure a VPN, you might be provided with connection details or a configuration file. The configuration file can be imported from this screen here. We&#39;ll configure ours manually. Select Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol.</p><p>VPN Name and General Information 00:52-01:56 Okay, we&#39;re asked to provide a name for the VPN. Let&#39;s call it TestOut. And the Gateway is the VPN service or device&#39;s IP address. A default gateway for a local network receives and manages the traffic. The VPN&#39;s gateway address will do the same thing and encrypt the traffic so that only the host and VPN provider can read the data.</p><p>For this example, we&#39;ll use a local address to complete the demonstration. Let&#39;s type 192.168.10.10. The username is most likely given by the VPN provider, whether it&#39;s a service purchased online or a VPN for a corporation. Okay, let&#39;s type TestOutUser.</p><p>The password field comes with different options. We can store the password for all users, for this user only, or have a prompt come up each time. Prompting for a password each time is probably the best idea. Unauthorized users will have a harder time sidestepping the security that way. Next, we select the IPsec Settings button. Check Enable IPsec tunnel to L2TP host and type the password provided by the VPN service.</p><p>Advanced Settings 01:56-02:34 We can expand the Advanced menu and specify which algorithm we want to use. These details are specific to the VPN we&#39;re attempting to connect to. There&#39;ll be different types of encryptions to choose from, like DES, AES, Triple DES, or RSA. On the Add VPN menu, we can select PPP Settings. You can see the different authentication methods I was talking about. Again, the specific one you use will be given by your VPN provider.</p><p>If you&#39;re connecting to a corporate or work network, you might need to provide an NT Domain. This would be the domain network name you&#39;re connecting to. Here, we can type testout.com.</p><p>IPv4 Settings 02:34-03:02 Let&#39;s look at the IPv4 tab. Most providers will supply an IP address through DHCP once you authenticate to their network. But some will assign static IPs that you&#39;ll need to configure on each host. On ours here, we can manually enter in the static IP information along with the subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers, and routes. Some newer providers are only assigning IPv6 addresses these days. If that were the case, we could disable IPv4 from this window.</p><p>IPV6 Settings 03:02-03:19 The IPv6 tab configurations are similar to IPv4. If you go with IPv6, this information will typically be handled automatically. But you could manually enter it for static addressing. We&#39;ll keep both IPv4 and IPv6 set to Automatic.</p><p>Save Changes 03:19-03:35 Once we&#39;ve entered all the configurations, we click Add. Now we&#39;ve successfully configured an IPsec VPN connection. That wasn&#39;t too complicated, right? When we&#39;re ready to connect, we toggle this button to turn the VPN on. We&#39;d just be prompted to enter the password in first.</p><p>Summary 03:35-03:45 That&#39;s it for this demonstration. In this demo, we showed you how to create an IPsec VPN.</p><h2 id="_15-10-3-vpn-access-and-authentication-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_15-10-3-vpn-access-and-authentication-facts"><span>15.10.3 VPN Access and Authentication Facts</span></a></h2><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>VPN access and authentication</li><li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</li><li>IPSec</li><li>Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)</li></ul><h3 id="vpn-access-and-authentication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vpn-access-and-authentication"><span>VPN Access and Authentication</span></a></h3><p>A virtual private network or VPN is a type of network that uses encryption to allow IP traffic to travel securely over a TCP/IP network and is used primarily to support secure communications over an untrusted network.
